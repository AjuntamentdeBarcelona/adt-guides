<div class="paragraph">
<p>Barcelona City Council has a policy for using and developing free software which is set out in the <a href="http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/ca/documentacio">Government Measure on Open Digitisation: Free software and agile development of public administration services</a>, approved in October 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This policy includes a series of principles and guidelines that are outlined in the following documents, annexed to the measure:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Guide spells out these principles and guidelines in a series of measures and recommendations to help municipal IT staff (at the IMI) in their daily work on projects based on free software.
It covers aspects such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Looking for and designing solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service procurement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing, implementing and maintaining information systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participation in free software communities</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-this-guide"><a class="anchor" href="#purpose-of-this-guide"></a>Purpose of this Guide</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Guide serves a double purpose:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>To help IMI staff use technologies based on free software so they make the most of its advantages and minimise potential risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help maintain Barcelona City Council’s reputation as a transparent and reliable
institutional collaborator in free software projects, taking into account the sector’s best practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The benefits expected from using free software and open standards are explained in the <a href="http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/sites/default/files/le_mesuradegovern_v2.pdf">Government Measure on Open Digitisation</a> (page 22).
We reproduce them here:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: the source code can be examined and audited by anyone with sufficient technical knowledge, with no need for explicit permission from the manufacturer or the City Council.
Without this characteristic it is difficult to trust the neutrality and security of a growing number of governmental and administrative processes that are implemented through software, such as voting processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong>: the use of open formats and standards enables different systems, possibly made by different manufacturers, to operate together without any legal or technical barriers.
This enables integrating different systems, reusing data and improving processes, for example.
It also ensures that the general public are not forced to use the technological solutions of specific providers to interact with the public authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sovereignty</strong>: transparency and interoperability greatly reduce dependence on the commercial strategies of manufacturers.
Users, in this case the City Council, are free to decide which systems they want to develop, scale or replace, as well as their own policies on security, privacy, updating and access to the systems.
In the case of organisations, sovereignty also encourages control over their own processes and knowledge generation and conservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: systems can be better adapted to the users’ needs, and they can be adapted and extended as those needs evolve, without depending on a particular provider.
Not only is development more flexible, it is also much easier and cheaper to assess alternatives, while operating conditions and maintenance can be modified more easily too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong>: interoperability enables different parts of the system that need renewing to be replaced while maintaining the availability of data.
Greater sovereignty also means there  is less risk that any part of the system, including the hardware, becomes obsolete.
Collaboration (between people and organisations) that is encouraged by free licences can be a great help in making a system more durable and stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: factors such as reducing costs related to license fees, more competition between suppliers, less risk of obsolescence and the possibility of sharing costs with other bodies or organisations, mean that free software based on open standards is the best option for ensuring that public authorities are efficient, as they are required to be by law.
The huge amount of software that can be combined enables solutions to be developed in many domains that are much better adapted to the end requirements, with less use of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reliability and security</strong>: being independent from commercial strategies means that the organisation can demand better quality services and take advantage of all the adjustments and improvements provided by the development and support community of each tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong>: transparency, and a fortunate combination of collaboration and competition, means that free software is an enormously fertile terrain for technological, social and process innovation.
The direct beneficiaries of this knowledge production are the people who produce and use the software, but indirectly the whole of society also benefits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides the commitment to base IMI’s technological architecture increasingly on free software, we need to know and exploit the particular features of free software projects and communities so as to enable and maximise these benefits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the enormous diversity that currently exists among free software projects, a series of practices have gradually arisen that are shared by most projects and organisations which have a certain degree of success.
These cover technical and legal aspects, as well as project management.
Some of these practices can be considered necessary, in the sense that the operational dynamics of free software projects reward certain types of conduct and penalise others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These practices are geared towards facilitating the widest possible diversity among participants, very often without any centralised coordination, while at the same time maintaining the quality of the product.
In some cases they can be very different from working methods used when there is no intention of publishing the source code.
This means IMI’s learning process and adaptation will have a cost, but we believe that it will be far outweighed by the organisational improvements it will bring – together with the incorporating agile methods – as well as all the benefits mentioned above.
As Karl Fogel says:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
the open source projects your organization participates in are a membrane through which your managers and developers are regularly exposed to people and ideas outside your organizational hierarchy.
It&#8217;s like having the benefits of attending a conference, but while still getting daily work done and without incurring travel expenses.
In a successful open source project, these benefits, once they start arriving, greatly outweigh the costs.
</blockquote>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To sum up, this guide intends to explain the best practices available for using and developing free software.
It does so by codifying and adapting these best practices to IMI, so they may serve as a guide in the learning process and in decision-making.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very good resource for understanding all the technical, legal and social aspects of free software is Karl Fogel’s book <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/index.html">Producing Open Source Software</a> (the 2017 edition, only available in an e-version, which can be freely consulted online).
We have taken many of the recommendations in that book into account in drawing up this Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guide also contains lots of recommendations on service procurement.
A good document for understanding the particular features of public procurement of free software is <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/guideline-public-procurement-open-source-software">Guideline on public procurement of Open Source Software</a>, published in 2010 by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh, Ruediger Glott, Patrice-Emmanuel Schmitz and Abdelkrim Boujraf, and commissioned by the European Commission under the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu//">Join Up</a> initiative.</p>
