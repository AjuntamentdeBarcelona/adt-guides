<h1>Community development</h1>
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In free software projects there is a culture of working in public eye, as this facilitates the conditions that make them technically and financially sustainable.
Increasing the flow of resources to projects is in the interest of all projects, and it involves:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing the number of people and institutions that use the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging any user, whether a person or an organisation, to participate in the project in any way they can, by contributing to the source code, testing, corrections, funding, dissemination, translations and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Outside this model, which is based on fostering collaboration, it is very difficult to reap some of the potential benefits offered by free software, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>.
There is no need to restrict this to the software code.
If there is to be real collaboration, transparency has to extend to all the communication infrastructure, knowledge and decision-making involved in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissemination of knowledge</strong>.
In contrast to other, classical business models, the interest here lies in knowledge of the product, even the most technical details, being distributed as widely as possible.
That reduces the technological risk and the City Council’s dependency on specific companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community participation</strong>.
This reinforces both the project, with more ideas and resources, and the local communities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working in public eye means the following elements should be publicly accessible in free formats (for reading) to anyone who is interested, so they do not have to use private tools and can do so anonymously (without having to register with any web service or much less having to hire for-payment services):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The code repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue manager or bug tracker (where, among other things, defects or bugs are notified and managed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The communication channels through which the technical team make technical decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working in public eye does NOT (necessarily) mean that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Project outsiders have write access to the repository (they are free to copy the code into their own repository and modify their copy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone has permission to write notifications of defects and intervene in the issue manager.
Each project can choose its own QA policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project team has to read and respond to all defect notifications (if they are open to writing) and questions via the public communication channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project team has to check all the suggestions and contributions (pull requests and patches) they might receive, if it is felt the resources are better invested in another task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_work_in_the_public_eye_from_day_one"><a class="anchor" href="#_work_in_the_public_eye_from_day_one"></a>Work in the public eye from day one</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A really important aspect to bear in mind is the longer you work in a closed, private environment, the more difficult it will be to open it up later on.
If you wait too long, maybe some measures will never be implemented, because their cost would be prohibitive.
The reasons for that can be summed up as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having communication channels open from day 1 does not mean “strangers” have to distract us from day 1.
In this Guide we explain how to make it clear what our commitments are, what we can achieve at each stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is impossible to compensate the incentives that developers have for doing things in a “quick and dirty” way, with future threats of publication.
If we do not work in public eye from the start, we will inevitably incur a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technological debt</a> with the intention of fixing things in the future (that never comes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the day for “freeing the code” arrives, you suddenly find you have:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specific user settings and passwords in the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notifications of defects that contain sensitive information that cannot be made public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correspondence between developers which mixes useful technical information with personal opinions that were not expressed so everybody could read them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependence on software components that cannot be used in a free software project, or which generate licence problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation or build procedures written with proprietary tools that do not allow them to be published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(And a never-ending list of other things).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Publishing the code means having to take difficult decisions, which would not have arisen if it had been in public eye from the start (wasting time cleaning up the defect log vs creating a new one and losing the entire log, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It creates a big “publication milestone” which poses a high risk for the project, because lots of changes have to be made all at once.
The whole project and its potential vulnerabilities are also exposed in one go (and many eyes will be looking, not always with good intentions).
This creates uncertainty and concern before the event.
Afterwards, it could cause an avalanche of issues that in normal conditions would have been staggered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these points are amply justified in sections <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/setting-tone.html#be-open-from-day-one">“Be Open From Day One”</a> and <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/governments-and-open-source.html#starting-open-for-govs">“Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects”</a> from the book <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/index.html">“Producing Open Source Software”</a>, which the people in charge of each project would do well to read.</p>

  Establish the need for free software development experience as a condition of technical solvency.
 <br>
  However many conditions are included in the contract, if the winning company has no experience of participating in free software projects, it is most likely that the product and the development process will end up not following many free software development conventions.
In most cases, there is no reason why that should be the result of bad faith but a lack of knowledge.</p>

  Besides being a policy in line with the Guide for Technological Procurement, disseminating knowledge of the product is very favourable to the interests of the project.
The <em>reservoirs of distributed knowledge</em> are one of the main strengths of free software projects.

  It also helps a great deal to ensure community development processes are established from the outset.</p>

  This is a matter of softening the required financial solvency criteria.
The aim is avoid putting artificial impediments that prevent small and medium-sized companies and cooperatives from submitting a bid when they meet (often more than large companies) the technical solvency criteria.
 <br>
  As explained in the Join Up <em>Guideline on public procurement of Open Source Software</em>&lt;document/guideline-public-procurement-open-source-software&gt;, page 47, (document commissioned by the European Commission), the greater interoperability and interdependence of suppliers when working with free software increases the sustainability of projects without the need for very high financial requirements.</p>

This is more important in free software projects than in proprietary ones because obtaining the participation of users and developers from outside the confines of the City Council can determine the project’s level of success.

  For big projects it is advisable from the outset to think about the Internet sites and platforms where it is essential to have a presence and ensure the domains and corresponding usernames are available.
Besides one or more own Internet domains names, a project might want to be present in GitHub or Twitter, for example.
Using the same username everywhere makes it easier for people to identify the project, even if they are not heavily involved in it.</p>

 <br>
  The mission statement is a short text of one or two paragraphs that allows people to decide in 30 seconds if they are interested in carrying on reading about the project or not.
It should be accompanied by the necessary links in case the answer is yes.
When writing it we can assume potential readers have a minimum knowledge of the project’s area of application.
People without such knowledge will probably not be interested in the project.
 <br>
  The text should at least be in English and Catalan, for using the most suitable version in each case.
 <br>
  It should appear in the following places at least:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The home page of the website targeted at project users, if there is one.
It should be capable of being seen without the need to scroll down the page on a desktop computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>README</code> file of the main repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project list at <a href="https://ajuntamentdebarcelona.github.io/">https://ajuntamentdebarcelona.github.io</a>.</p>

This measure is to ensure potential collaborators do not have to look too far to know whether they are willing to contribute to the project or not.

It is also important to state under which specific licence (including the version) the software is being distributed, using the full name or identifier, whichever is best in each case, exactly as they appear at <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/" class="bare">https://spdx.org/licenses/</a>.

<p>It is very important to be transparent and not falsify the real status of the project.
It is more harmful to attract users with false expectations (that it will be impossible to satisfy) than err on the side of caution when outlining the progress made or expected.
All projects have defects and it makes everyone’s life easier (project developers, promoters and potential outside users) to deal with them transparently.
Most successful free software software projects have a “Known bugs” section on their website, and some of these bugs stay there for years.</p>

  Barcelona City Council might be interested in software projects it has not started but makes some sort of contribution to (add-ons, translations, hours of maintenance work) recognising and publicising these contributions.
What form that takes will depend on each project and the nature of the contributions.
Some examples:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mention in a public list of bodies that participate in or contribute to the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The City Council logo appearing in the project website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

  It is very important not to delay building and documenting a software build system, because without it, the effort any developer has to put in to testing the tool will probably be too great for anyone to try it.
 <br>
  Needless to say, users and potential collaborators in a free software project cannot be forced to depend on tools that are not free as well, and, it is best to choose the most commonly used ones which the majority of developers are most familiar with.
That might vary from one community to another.
Some examples of commonly used build tools (some of which can also be used in configuration and installation procedures) that we recommend are:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For Java projects: Maven, Ant (also for other languages).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Python projects follow the advice of <a href="http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" class="bare">http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a>, which also include information on packaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For JavaScript projects (and front-end in general): Gulp.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Ruby projects: Rake.</p>
</li>
<li>

  As a condition of transparency, the source code used at any time in building and deploying the services in production must be available in the City Council’s public repository, preferably under the <code>master</code> branch.
Any security patch, improvement or modification of any kind that is applied to the code in production must be reflected in the repository.

  Every repository should have an explicit versions policy.
Software projects normally use version identifiers based on <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> number sequences.
 <br>
  A suitable versions policy must be chosen for each project.
Each technological community (Java, Python, Drupal, etc.) might have a preferred versions policy so it is advisable to find out which one it is and stick to it.
If there is no clear policy, we can subscribe to a well-known generic policy, such as <a href="http://semver/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>

Before releasing an existing software component or system in use at Barcelona City Council under a free software licence, we need to check whether:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It corresponds to a general need: it could be useful to more institutions or organisations, besides the City Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has some aspect that sets it apart from other, existing free software solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barcelona City Council holds legal title over the whole code it aims to release, or can obtain legal title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can be used on free software platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code (and associated documentation) is sufficiently developed and of a high enough quality, or the improvement requirements have been clearly identified and there is a strategy for tackling them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freeing the code will not pose any legal risks for either party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources are available for responding to maintenance issues until this responsibility is handed over to other bodies or organisations, possibly a free software community of developers and users.</p>

  This means explaining that, up to a certain date, the project did not operate in the public eye, so some inconvenience is to be expected.
Developer and user expectations regarding the quality and transparency of some aspects of the project need to be lowered.
The commitments made to make it possible to free the code also need explaining.
For example, there may be lots of sensitive data in the code repository (specific user data, etcetera) so it has been decided to remove the version control history and create a new top-skim repository that only contains the latest version.
 <br>
  This information should be published in at least the following places:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The development website (now public).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public mail lists.</p>
</li>

  If we have a way of contacting people who have participated or who are participating in a project we are going to release, for example, by means of private emails, it is worth informing them (not negotiating) of this fact.
Freeing a code that was not initially written to be free software might make its authors uncomfortable, so we need to explain that that’s normal.
