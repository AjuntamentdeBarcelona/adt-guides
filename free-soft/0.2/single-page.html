<div class="paragraph">
<p>Barcelona City Council has a policy for using and developing free software which is set out in the <a href="http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/ca/documentacio">Government Measure: Free software and agile development of public administration services</a>, approved in October 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This policy includes a series of principles and guidelines that are outlined in the following documents, annexed to the measure:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/sites/default/files/guia_adt_2_codi_de_practiques_tecnologiques_cat_2017_af.pdf">Code of Technological Practices</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Guide spells out these principles and guidelines in a series of measures and recommendations to help municipal IT staff (at the IMI, Municipal Institute of Information Technology) in their daily work on projects based on free software.
It covers aspects such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Looking for and designing solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service procurement</p>
</li>

<h3 id="_benefits_of_using_and_developing_free_it_solutions"><a class="anchor" href="#_benefits_of_using_and_developing_free_it_solutions"></a>1.1. Benefits of using and developing free IT solutions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main benefit expected from using and developing free software is that the City Council regains or maintains control of their computing, not ceding it to private hands.
It is crucial for an entity that implements public services and processes a lot of information about citizens to know exactly what it is being executed, in what computers, who has access to the data, etc. As the <a href="https://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a> puts it:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The state needs to insist on free software in its own computing for the sake of its computational sovereignty (the state&#8217;s control over its own computing). All users deserve control over their computing, but the state has a responsibility to the people to maintain control over the computing it does on their behalf. Most government activities now depend on computing, and its control over those activities depends on its control over that computing. Losing this control in an agency whose mission is critical undermines national security.</p>
</div>

<p>Both the GNU document above and the <a href="https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/digital/en/blog/barcelona-digital-government-open-agile-and-participatory">Release note of the Government Measure: Free software and agile development of public administration services</a> envision other benefits:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encouraging local software support businesses, more easily including small and medium-sized businesses in the procurement process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating crucial new capabilities in the public sector through internalisation of staff and a programme to create in-house skills to drive transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing transparency and auditability of administrative processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never requiring individuals or organizations that need to interact with the City Council to use a nonfree program (that would be equivalent to a state-sanctioned monopoly).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring data sovereignty, privacy and security, for the citizens and for the municipality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding vendor lock-in and, more generally, freeing IT policy and planning from commercial strategies, constructing better tailored, more flexible, more sustainable solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saving money, by avoiding proprietary license fees and through sharing and pooling of resources among municipalities and other government agencies.</p>

<h3 id="_purpose_of_this_guide"><a class="anchor" href="#_purpose_of_this_guide"></a>1.2. Purpose of this Guide</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Guide serves a double purpose:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>To help IMI staff use technologies based on free software so they make the most of its advantages and minimise potential risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help maintain Barcelona City Council&#8217;s reputation as a transparent and reliable
institutional collaborator in free software projects, taking into account the sector&#8217;s best practices.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the enormous diversity that currently exists among free software projects, a series of practices have gradually arisen that are shared by most projects and organisations which have a certain degree of success.
These cover technical and legal aspects, as well as project management.
Some of these practices can be considered necessary, in the sense that the operational dynamics of free software projects reward certain types of conduct and penalise others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases free software common practices can be very different from working methods used when there is no intention of publishing the source code under a free license.
This means IMI&#8217;s learning process and adaptation will have a cost, but we believe that it will be far outweighed by the organisational improvements it will bring – together with the incorporating agile methods –.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document codifies and adapts these best practices to IMI, so they may serve as a guide in the learning process and in decision-making.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_to_find_out_more"><a class="anchor" href="#_to_find_out_more"></a>1.3. To find out more</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very good resource for understanding all the technical, legal and social aspects of free software development is Karl Fogel’s book <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/index.html">Producing Open Source Software</a> (the 2017 edition, only available in an e-version, which can be freely consulted online).
The book uses the term <em>open source</em>, which basically refers to the same range of projects as <em>free software</em>.
(The proponents of both terms differ on their political and philosophical views, but the practical aspects we treat in this document are mostly shareable by both camps.)
We have taken many of the practical recommendations in that book into account in drawing up this Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Guide also contains lots of recommendations on service procurement.
A good document for understanding the particular features of public procurement of free software in the context of the European Union is <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/guideline-public-procurement-open-source-software">Guideline on public procurement of Open Source Software</a>, published in 2010 by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh, Ruediger Glott, Patrice-Emmanuel Schmitz and Abdelkrim Boujraf, and commissioned by the European Commission under the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu//">Join Up</a> initiative.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_document_organization"><a class="anchor" href="#_document_organization"></a>2. Document organization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Guide contains a series of guidelines that we have divided into:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Measures</strong> that must be adopted and implemented in all projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> that do not have to be followed but which could be useful in certain situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project managers are responsible for checking whether the measures are being implemented properly and deciding which recommendations to follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some measures are sufficiently complex to merit being broken down into <strong>sub-measures</strong> that can be individually validated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some are impossible to adopt in certain projects, so in those cases we have tried to offer some <strong>alternatives</strong> (guidelines that will be tagged as such throughout the guide).
Each measure and its sub-measures are interlinked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each measure, recommendation or alternative consists of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A unique identifier throughout the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of tags.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>tags</strong> help to restrict when and in what types of projects each measure and recommendation are important.
For example, they can serve to generate a checklist of things that project management needs to check.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter explains which type of tags are used throughout the guide.
The other chapters set out the measures and recommendations by subject areas and provide some necessary context for understanding the relevance of each measure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the [Annex: Lists of measure and recommendations by tag] you will find various lists of measures and recommendations classified by tags.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_use_case_tags"><a class="anchor" href="#_use_case_tags"></a>2.1. Use-case tags</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section we define the different situations or <strong>use-cases</strong> that can arise in technological projects in relation to the free software components they are based on.
These Use-Cases then determine which measures and recommendations affect each project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each <strong>project</strong> defines an information system, and each system has a certain number of software <strong>components</strong>.
Some components are distinguished from the rest because each component has its own source code <strong>repository</strong>.
(Occasionally we find complex components whose code, for practical reasons, is shared between different repositories which are tagged and distributed jointly).
The different components in a particular system can be run on the same equipment or be distributed between different machines.
Likewise, they may operate as part of the same process or various processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following use-cases are contemplated:</p>
</div>
<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all spread">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 20%;">
<col style="width: 80%;">

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock"><code>Document</code></p></td>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock"><strong>Publish documents not linked to a single project</strong>: we have documentation that is not directly linked to a piece of software but we want to make it freely available in a public repository.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the Use-Cases, except the <code>Integration</code> and <code>Document</code> Use-Cases, refer to a single software component.
This means different Use-Cases can coincide in the same project if different components are affected in a different way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We exclude from the analysis contributions to projects that do not involve modifying the code of a component, or creating a repository, such as contributions to documenting or facilitating the adoption of certain tools by third parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Integration</code>, <code>Adaptation</code>, <code>Plugin</code> and <code>NewProduct</code> use-cases may occasionally require a <strong>migration</strong>, if we find ourselves in a situation of implementing a system that partially or totally replaces the functions of a previous system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_integration_code_use_case"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_integration_code_use_case"></a>2.1.1. <code>Integration</code> Use-Case</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Use-Case may involve creating one or more own repositories, not to manage the code of any software <em>per se</em> but to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Link it to project management tools such as issue managers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save and link documents relating to using and operating the system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save configuration files and scripts necessary for deploying the system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save configuration files and scripts necessary for running testing and continuous integration environments, including <em>virtualisation</em> and <em>containerisation</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save system design and customisation features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save instructions for installing and using the system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save integration tests of the various components</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With regard to customisation elements, we highlight the need for <strong>translating</strong> user interface texts and other aspects of localisation and internationalisation (l10n, i18n).
We contemplate two possibilities:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following conditions are met: (1) the software to be translated is designed to incorporate translations of the interface, and (2) the translations to be carried out may be of general interest to other potential users of the tool.
In this case, we will try to fit the translations into the original project, which means we would find ourselves in the <a href="#escenari-adaptacio">Adaptation Use-Case</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the two conditions mentioned above is not met: we store the files needed for doing the translation in an own repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1. Wordpress</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A hypothetical example would be a web portal built using a content management system such as Wordpress, with a MariaDB database.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="escenari-integracio"></a>These are standard free software components but to make managing them easier, it might be useful to save customised elements such as CSS files or a list of Wordpress extensions to be uploaded in a repository, along with Docker images that include all the necessary elements for its deployment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_adaptation_code_use_case"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_adaptation_code_use_case"></a>2.1.2. <code>Adaptation</code> Use-Case</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This use-case might involve creating one or more own repositories with the same contents described for the <a href="#escenari-integracio">Integration Use-Case</a>.
A distinctive feature of this use-case, however, is that Barcelona City Council is sponsoring the development of a significant contribution to a free software product that could potentially be incorporated into the original product (even if this integration does not take place while it is being developed).
These contributions must take the form of a series of commits in a repository linked in some way to that of the original producnt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be various types of contributions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>New features that Barcelona City Council needs and which could be of interest to other entities or users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete translations (or significant coverage) of the user interface, as well as other localisation (l10n) and internationalisation (i18n) improvements that might be of general use to other potential users of the tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the translations and localisation elements are mixed with the City Council’s own customised elements, or if the original product is not designed to incorporate new translations and localisations, then it is not possible to plan a contribution like this because we would be in the <a href="#escenari-integracio">Integration Use-case</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 2. Barcelona City Council’s ethical mail box</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was an original piece of software, that of <a href="https://www.globaleaks.org/">Globaleaks</a>, and the features of generating an internal file and sending a reply to the user in the form of a PDF were incorporated into that.
These features are now part of the <a href="https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks">Globaleaks main repository</a>’s master branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="escenari-adaptacio"></a>Customisation tasks have been carried out in the same project, including the translation of the interface into Catalan, but as some user texts are not for general use but instead are the City Council’s own customisations, it has not been possible to contribute the translation itself to the original project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_plugin_code_use_case"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_plugin_code_use_case"></a>2.1.3. <code>Plugin</code> Use-case</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a use-case half way between integrating new features into an already existing product (<a href="#escenari-adaptacio">Adaptation Use-case</a>) and developing a new product (<a href="\l">NewProduct Use-case</a>), and it shares features of both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the one hand, it starts with an existing piece of software to which a feature has to be added.
On the other hand, the software architecture is modular and provides for extension by means of a standardised mechanism that enables semi-independent development of the new modules in such a way that some aspects are quite similar to a new product.
In particular, the new modules have their own repository (which is not a copy of the original product’s repository) and the releases are not linked to those of the framework product.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 3. Open Data Barcelona</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="http://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/">City Council’s open data portal</a> is based on <a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> open data portal software.
This product is <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/plugin-interfaces.html">easily extendible</a> by means of plugins or extensions and when the new portal was being developed it was necessary to modify an existing plugin (which would also correspond to the <a href="#escenari-adaptacio">Adaptation Use-case</a>) as well as create new ones.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_newproduct_code_use_case"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_newproduct_code_use_case"></a>2.1.4. <code>NewProduct</code> Use-case</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When there is no component or combination of components available that satisfy a specific need, a new product has to be developed.
This product may be based on other, already existing components, such as frameworks, libraries, database management systems, etc.</p>

<div class="title">Example 4. Decidim.Barcelona</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://decidim.org/">Decidim</a> is a participative democracy tool for cities and organisations.
From the outset, its development was sponsored by Barcelona City Council, although other organisations that use it are now beginning to contribute resources.
It is based on the website development framework <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.
This framework greatly facilitates the development of new website applications but these do not merely consist of integrating and configuring components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://decidim.org/">Decidim</a>’s history is a little odd because it began with an attempt to adapt existing software, <a href="https://github.com/consul/consul">Consul</a>.
Later it was necessary to make a fork from the original software and, finally, it was decided to rewrite the program (improving the modularity of the code, among other things).</p>

<h4 id="_code_publication_code_use_case"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_publication_code_use_case"></a>2.1.5. <code>Publication</code> Use-case</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Barcelona City Council owns a lot of software that is currently in use but which has never been published.
The specific measures and recommendations for this use-case explain the additional checks that are necessary for publishing, under licence, a software code that initially was not conceived for free distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be several reasons that might justify publishing a software program, provided it meets certain quality requirements.
One possible situation is you might want to launch a new development contract for extending or adapting “ manner” an existing component (that would be the equivalent of combining the <a href="#escenari-adaptacio">Adaptation Use-case</a> and the <a href="#escenari-publicacio">Publication Use-case</a><a id="escenari-publicacio"></a>).</p>

<h4 id="_code_document_code_use_case"><a class="anchor" href="#_code_document_code_use_case"></a>2.1.6. <code>Document</code> Use-case</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes you may want to publish a document that has been drafted (or commissioned) that might not be linked directly to a single software project.
Examples would be market studies, research projects, graphic design elements (such as logos) and so on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When classifying measures and recommendations, it is also worth taking into account at what point they should be applied.
As a general rule, we could say that technological projects go through the following stages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Conception</strong>: stage when a new need is detected and the idea of the project arises, which usually includes drawing up a preliminary design and possibly carrying out other preliminary studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Procurement</strong>: drawing up the specifications for acquiring services (development or other types of services).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Development</strong>: creating the source code, documents and other tools, including the infrastructure necessary for building them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Putting into production</strong>: deploying the service, including the possible migration of data and processes from one or more previous systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploitation</strong>: stage which lasts throughout the useful life of the system in production, including operational and maintenance tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taking all this into account, the Guide uses the following tags to highlight key project stages:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In free software projects there is a culture of working in public eye, as this facilitates the conditions that make them technically and financially sustainable.
Increasing the flow of resources to projects is in the interest of all projects, and it involves:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing the number of people and institutions that use the software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging any user, whether a person or an organisation, to participate in the project in any way they can, by contributing to the source code, testing, corrections, funding, dissemination, translations and so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Outside this model, which is based on fostering collaboration, it is very difficult to reap some of the potential benefits offered by free software, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>.
There is no need to restrict this to the software code.
If there is to be real collaboration, transparency has to extend to all the communication infrastructure, knowledge and decision-making involved in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dissemination of knowledge</strong>.
In contrast to other, classical business models, the interest here lies in knowledge of the product, even the most technical details, being distributed as widely as possible.
That reduces the technological risk and the City Council’s dependency on specific companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community participation</strong>.
This reinforces both the project, with more ideas and resources, and the local communities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working in public eye means the following elements should be publicly accessible in free formats (for reading) to anyone who is interested, so they do not have to use private tools and can do so anonymously (without having to register with any web service or much less having to hire for-payment services):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The code repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The issue manager or bug tracker (where, among other things, defects or bugs are notified and managed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The communication channels through which the technical team make technical decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Working in public eye does NOT (necessarily) mean that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Project outsiders have write access to the repository (they are free to copy the code into their own repository and modify their copy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone has permission to write notifications of defects and intervene in the issue manager.
Each project can choose its own QA policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project team has to read and respond to all defect notifications (if they are open to writing) and questions via the public communication channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project team has to check all the suggestions and contributions (pull requests and patches) they might receive, if it is felt the resources are better invested in another task.</p>

<h3 id="_work_in_the_public_eye_from_day_one"><a class="anchor" href="#_work_in_the_public_eye_from_day_one"></a>3.1. Work in the public eye from day one</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A really important aspect to bear in mind is the longer you work in a closed, private environment, the more difficult it will be to open it up later on.
If you wait too long, maybe some measures will never be implemented, because their cost would be prohibitive.
The reasons for that can be summed up as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having communication channels open from day 1 does not mean “strangers” have to distract us from day 1.
In this Guide we explain how to make it clear what our commitments are, what we can achieve at each stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is impossible to compensate the incentives that developers have for doing things in a “quick and dirty” way, with future threats of publication.
If we do not work in public eye from the start, we will inevitably incur a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technological debt</a> with the intention of fixing things in the future (that never comes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the day for “freeing the code” arrives, you suddenly find you have:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Specific user settings and passwords in the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notifications of defects that contain sensitive information that cannot be made public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correspondence between developers which mixes useful technical information with personal opinions that were not expressed so everybody could read them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependence on software components that cannot be used in a free software project, or which generate licence problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation or build procedures written with proprietary tools that do not allow them to be published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(And a never-ending list of other things).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Publishing the code means having to take difficult decisions, which would not have arisen if it had been in public eye from the start (wasting time cleaning up the defect log vs creating a new one and losing the entire log, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It creates a big “publication milestone” which poses a high risk for the project, because lots of changes have to be made all at once.
The whole project and its potential vulnerabilities are also exposed in one go (and many eyes will be looking, not always with good intentions).
This creates uncertainty and concern before the event.
Afterwards, it could cause an avalanche of issues that in normal conditions would have been staggered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these points are amply justified in sections <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/setting-tone.html#be-open-from-day-one">“Be Open From Day One”</a> and <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/governments-and-open-source.html#starting-open-for-govs">“Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects”</a> from the book <a href="https://producingoss.com/en/index.html">“Producing Open Source Software”</a>, which the people in charge of each project would do well to read.</p>

  Besides being a policy in line with the Guide for Technological Procurement, disseminating knowledge of the product is very favourable to the interests of the project.

  This is a matter of softening the required financial solvency criteria.
The aim is avoid putting artificial impediments that prevent small and medium-sized companies and cooperatives from submitting a bid when they meet (often more than large companies) the technical solvency criteria.
 <br>
  As explained in the Join Up <em>Guideline on public procurement of Open Source Software</em>&lt;document/guideline-public-procurement-open-source-software&gt;, page 47, (document commissioned by the European Commission), the greater interoperability and interdependence of suppliers when working with free software increases the sustainability of projects without the need for very high financial requirements.</p>

  For big projects it is advisable from the outset to think about the Internet sites and platforms where it is essential to have a presence and ensure the domains and corresponding usernames are available.
Besides one or more own Internet domains names, a project might want to be present in GitHub or Twitter, for example.
Using the same username everywhere makes it easier for people to identify the project, even if they are not heavily involved in it.</p>

  The mission statement is a short text of one or two paragraphs that allows people to decide in 30 seconds if they are interested in carrying on reading about the project or not.
It should be accompanied by the necessary links in case the answer is yes.
When writing it we can assume potential readers have a minimum knowledge of the project’s area of application.
People without such knowledge will probably not be interested in the project.

  The text should at least be in English and Catalan, for using the most suitable version in each case.
 <br>
  It should appear in the following places at least:</p>

This measure is to ensure potential collaborators do not have to look too far to know whether they are willing to contribute to the project or not.

It is also important to state under which specific licence (including the version) the software is being distributed, using the full name or identifier, whichever is best in each case, exactly as they appear at <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/" class="bare">https://spdx.org/licenses/</a>.

<p>It is very important to be transparent and not falsify the real status of the project.
It is more harmful to attract users with false expectations (that it will be impossible to satisfy) than err on the side of caution when outlining the progress made or expected.
All projects have defects and it makes everyone’s life easier (project developers, promoters and potential outside users) to deal with them transparently.
Most successful free software software projects have a “Known bugs” section on their website, and some of these bugs stay there for years.</p>

  Barcelona City Council might be interested in software projects it has not started but makes some sort of contribution to (add-ons, translations, hours of maintenance work) recognising and publicising these contributions.
What form that takes will depend on each project and the nature of the contributions.
Some examples:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mention in a public list of bodies that participate in or contribute to the project.</p>

  It is very important not to delay building and documenting a software build system, because without it, the effort any developer has to put in to testing the tool will probably be too great for anyone to try it.
 <br>
  Needless to say, users and potential collaborators in a free software project cannot be forced to depend on tools that are not free as well, and, it is best to choose the most commonly used ones which the majority of developers are most familiar with.
That might vary from one community to another.
Some examples of commonly used build tools (some of which can also be used in configuration and installation procedures) that we recommend are:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For Java projects: Maven, Ant (also for other languages).</p>

  As a condition of transparency, the source code used at any time in building and deploying the services in production must be available in the City Council’s public repository, preferably under the <code>master</code> branch.

  Every repository should have an explicit versions policy.
Software projects normally use version identifiers based on <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> number sequences.

  A suitable versions policy must be chosen for each project.
Each technological community (Java, Python, Drupal, etc.) might have a preferred versions policy so it is advisable to find out which one it is and stick to it.
If there is no clear policy, we can subscribe to a well-known generic policy, such as <a href="http://semver/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>It corresponds to a general need: it could be useful to more institutions or organisations, besides the City Council.</p>

<li>
<p>It has some aspect that sets it apart from other, existing free software solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barcelona City Council holds legal title over the whole code it aims to release, or can obtain legal title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can be used on free software platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code (and associated documentation) is sufficiently developed and of a high enough quality, or the improvement requirements have been clearly identified and there is a strategy for tackling them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freeing the code will not pose any legal risks for either party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources are available for responding to maintenance issues until this responsibility is handed over to other bodies or organisations, possibly a free software community of developers and users.</p>

  This means explaining that, up to a certain date, the project did not operate in the public eye, so some inconvenience is to be expected.
Developer and user expectations regarding the quality and transparency of some aspects of the project need to be lowered.
The commitments made to make it possible to free the code also need explaining.
For example, there may be lots of sensitive data in the code repository (specific user data, etcetera) so it has been decided to remove the version control history and create a new top-skim repository that only contains the latest version.
 <br>
  This information should be published in at least the following places:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The development website (now public).</p>
</li>
<li>

  If we have a way of contacting people who have participated or who are participating in a project we are going to release, for example, by means of private emails, it is worth informing them (not negotiating) of this fact.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The technical infrastructure required for hosting a free software project usually consists of various elements and tools that are often interlinked in complex ways.
In this chapter we recommend some common tools and practices for using them in the sector.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A general principle that is spelt out in the measures in the chapter is that people who participate in a project must never be compelled to install proprietary software on their equipment.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_websites_associated_with_the_project"><a class="anchor" href="#_websites_associated_with_the_project"></a>4.1. Websites associated with the project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical software project might have two websites:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A development website</strong> for people contributing code or technical documentation to the project, whether they are hired by the City Council or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A website for users and participants in general</strong>.
That includes people or organisations that might want to install and use the software outside the City Council but also people who are interested in the project even though they are not direct users of the software.
On this website we need to facilitate and encourage people to participate in the project with contributions that are less (or not at all) technical: funding, user documents, pre-release testing, dissemination, translations and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually both types of content are necessary but it is not always necessary to be in two separate places, with different domain names.
In each project it leads, the City Council will have to assess to what extent the needs and mentalities of the two sets of people are different, therefore making it impossible for a single website model to accommodate both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The section <a href="#repositori-de-codi-i-control-de-versions">Code repository and version control</a> explains how to set up the development site, the only one required from the outset.
We can assess if there is also a need for a site geared towards other participant profiles as the project grows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is useful is for the project to have its own domain name (or a permanent URL under a City Council domain) from the outset.
If necessary, this could be redirected to where the project website is.</p>
</div>
<div id="4.1.A" class="sidebarblock recommendation">

<p>This means from the outset the City Council having the URL that will serve to identify the project under its control.

</div>
<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p>It offers good integration with the rest of a product’s technical and social infrastructure: issue managing, continuous integration, development communication channels, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also enables (part of) a product’s documentation to be saved and displayed, which could be a wiki.
The presentation of the information is sufficiently user-friendly for us to put off building a website for project users and participants in general.</p>

<p>A Gitlab portal of an organisation participating in developing the project
(or any future Barcelona City Council Gitlab portal).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these reasons could be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a project many public sector participants intervene in and a consortium or ad-hoc organisation is set up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development company exercises strong leadership over the project, more than the City Council might do, and wants the basic infrastructure under its control.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In opting for this alternative, it must be borne in mind that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We cannot give up Git as our version control system.
It is currently the most widely used tool which all developers are familiar with and it offers some good practices for open project management which would be much more confusing with older systems (such as CSV or Subversion).
If certain procedures have to be performed on another tool, for example, Subversion, the solution is to do the development in open on Git, and keep a Subversion mirror automated using the command <code>git <code>svn</code> ``dcommit</code>, as explained, for example, at <a href="http://www.kerrybuckley.org/2009/10/06/maintaining-a-read-only-svn-mirror-of-a-git-repository/" class="bare">http://www.kerrybuckley.org/2009/10/06/maintaining-a-read-only-svn-mirror-of-a-git-repository/</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either way, there has to be an up-to-date replica of the main repository in the City Council GitHub space,
to show all the contributions made to free software projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>README</code> file content (and markup) in the City Council GitHub space,
the GitHub.io space and the other sites with a source code link will indicate which is (or are) the main repository (repositories) where development is carried out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whichever they are, both the issue managing tool and the continuous integration system must be public and capable of being used by everyone,
without paying subscriptions for any service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the project source code has to be downloadable by anyone at any time.
GitHub makes that easy by providing buttons for downloading a <code>zip</code> file or showing the necessary commands for cloning the repository using Git.
If GitHub is not used, the repository’s public site must also provide both these types of download (<code>zip</code> file or <code>tar.gz</code> and command <code>git clone</code>).</p>

<p>If the project’s potential users are mainly local, it might be a good idea to translate the contents of the <code>README</code> file or part of them.

<p>One tool all free software projects need is an issue manager or bug tracker.
At the City Council we assign it the following functions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide notification of any defects detected (bugs tracked) by users and developers.
Also to make their treatment, evolution and eventual solution transparent.
It is important that the changes (commits) that solve a defect (bug) point it out in their message.
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/">GitHub has keywords for this</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow up tasks that are pending.
This enables one or more commits to then be linked with the closing of an issue It is also possible to see who tasks have been assigned to and how they are prioritised.
One option is to specify estimated completion dates.
All this contributes to the transparency and traceability of the development process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow up how the contributions of the different parts are managed by means of the pull request mechanism.
The bug tracker could even be open to feature requests and the GitHub space could be used for publicly managing and prioritising.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It needs to be borne in mind that the bug tracker is not only important for the everyday work of developers but also that many project observers use it as a measure of how serious the project is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first lines of communication between developers are the repository commit messages and the issue manager threads.
Many technical decisions are taken in these threads but the discussions that take place in them should always be highly focused and strictly technical.
When the area under discussion broadens out, it is necessary to resort to other channels.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially all new projects have to create a development mail list or a discussion forum, with public files.
This is the channel through which the opinion of the different parties or individuals taking part in the project is sought and strategic decisions are taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first there will not be much that separates the developers and first users or early adopters as regards concerns and language, the latter usually being highly motivated.
Consequently, in many cases the same channel will suffice.
Later it may be necessary to create specialised communication channels for different kinds of participants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the nature and make-up of the team, it might be useful to have a chat room for more immediate communication.
Either way, it would supplement the list or the forum, never replace it.
The list or forum is where the whole history of the project (discussions, decisions, etc.) is recorded for reference, a very valuable asset for the whole project community, present and future.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, unless our need is very specialised, there will already be a free software solution (or combination of solutions) that would solve the problem, at least partly.</p>

<p>Finding out if a project suits our needs and meets the minimum requirements on a technical, legal and social level could prove costly.
But the benefits of finding an existing project to join, instead of reinventing the wheel (and avoiding the so-called <strong>Not invented here</strong> or “<strong>NIH</strong> syndrome”) can be extraordinary, in the short and long terms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To start with, maybe many of the features we need are already being implemented, so we could build prototypes and carry out concept tests very quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can take advantage of the experience acquired by other users who have tried to implement a system similar to the one we want, possibly discovering opportunities we had not thought about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can share the cost of building a complex tool with other users and organisations.
This includes potential future features and applications, which could in turn interest other users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the product has a sufficiently large user base, we get a tool that develops over time, improving with the contributions of others, adapting to future technological changes and incorporating our new features or those of third parties.
With very little outlay on maintenance we get long-term sustainability and less danger of creating a <strong>technological debt</strong>.</p>

  Here we understand contributions in a broad sense: commits in the code repository, bug reports, translations, etc.
 <br>
  Diversity (different people and organisations involved) is more important than the number of contributions (e.g. the number of commits per month).
 <br>
  If the component shows contributions by important organisations (companies of a certain size, universities, institutions), it is very likely that, even if some contributions fail, the project will continue.
But it could also be a very good sign that lots of people make contributions on an individual basis and these are taken into account.</p>

  First of all we need to look at the bug tracker, noting:
 <br>
  The number of defects notified.
We shouldn’t panic if there are a lot of open and unsolved notifications, because the number of issues and bugs tends to grow in a straight line with the number of users but the number of developers usually grows more slowly.
 <br>
  Let the developers gradually respond to the issues.
We want to stress this point: if there are a large number of users, there will always be lots of open issues.
The important thing is to see whether the developers are regularly involved in the bug tracker, that they haven’t abandoned it.
 <br>
  Then it is important to look at the project’s public activity, bearing in mind:
 <br>
  How long ago the latest releases were published, news items were posted in a blog or similar site.
 <br>
  The tone, usefulness and diversity of the participants in the project’s discussion forums and public communication channels.</p>

  When products have a free software licence, it will always be possible to contact someone to get them modified, maintained or have problems solved.
However, we have more guarantee of success if there are already companies or people offering professional support for the component in question, and it can therefore be assumed they are very familiar with it.
 <br>
  It is better if there are various companies offering commercial services in relation to the product than just one, because in the latter case we would be more dependent on that company.
It is a normal business model for the company that develops the product (perhaps without hardly any external community support) to also offer commercial support for it.
So it should not simply be discarded but it is better if the professional support is diversified.
 <br>
  The fact that there are already companies offering professional services in relation to a product at the start could also make it easier to carry out a tentative evaluation of the cost of adapting or maintaining it.</p>

  Transparency is a basic cornerstone of free software.

  The fact that project source codes and management tools (bug trackers, mail lists, forums) are public means that it is possible to obtain some objective metrics on free software that it would be very difficult to get in the case of privately owned software.
 <br>

 <br>
  Number of comments, from <a href="https://openhub.net/">OpenHub</a>.
 <br>

  When we need to adapt an existing source code, if we know the project and the community that sustains it beforehand, it has lots of advantages:

  Any solution component included in Debian’s stable distribution at the project design stage, or which can be run in the stable version without having to be adapted and which is multi-architecture, is considered to be a durable and reliable component.
 <br>
  Otherwise, select components which, in their standard version downloadable to the project website, can be run on free software platforms, preferably GNU/Linux and without any restrictions in terms of:
 <br>
  Requiring a particular GNU/Linux distribution (e.g. a program that only runs in CentOS environments and not on Debian).
 <br>
  Versions of the main platform elements that are too specific, especially if they are too old or beyond their standard maintenance period (e.g. a program that requires a Linux kernel in a 3.* version, or some basic libraries of the system that are obsolete.
 <br>
  Requiring a specific hardware architecture (e.g. solutions that only run on Intel machines).</p>

  When there is a code that has been published with a free licence but the product needs to be developed in a direction that is incompatible with the plans governing the project, it might be necessary to make a fork (in the strict sense of the word, a social fork).
 <br>
  Creating a fork has many disadvantages, so it has to be the last resort.
It is much more difficult to share code with the original product once the fork has been created.
And perhaps even more significant, it implies splitting the original community and forcing each developer to decide which version to prioritise.</p>

  In the case of a contract, include this in the specifications and add that IMI has the last word on including a dependency.
 <br>
  Example clause: <strong>Managing software dependencies</strong>.
 <br>
  The successful bidder should keep a thorough record of all the software packages used in the solution, which have to be distributed under a software licence accepted by the Free Software Foundation (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html" class="bare">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html</a>) or the Open Source Initiative (OSI, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses" class="bare">https://opensource.org/licenses</a>).
As an additional requirement, the licence for all packages used should not pose any incompatibility problems with the main product licence, EUPL-1.2.
Barcelona City Council reserves the right to demand a software dependency be removed if it considers that it constitutes a legal risk and the successful bidder has to replace the package with another one, or cover the feature with a development of its own.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many levels of participation in a free software project, and none of them should be closed.
Apart from the development team, who are usually hired for that purpose, other people might contribute on an occasional or ongoing basis.
This chapter focuses on the more social aspects of how to work in this kind of community which is created around these projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_contributing_to_free_software_communities"><a class="anchor" href="#_contributing_to_free_software_communities"></a>6.1. Contributing to free software communities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of contribution covers much more than the code.
It can also consist in:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Translations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug reports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other tasks</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A basic rule is that the contributions are always individual, both in our own projects as well as when we contribute to external projects.
That means it is always possible to trace the specific person who has done it, even if they work or participate on behalf of an organisation.
The reasons for this are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is the only model which free software projects are structurally equipped to handle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In free software projects, reputation is what makes everything tick, and that is earned or lost individually.
People will rely more or less on the code someone has developed depending on the strength of previous contributions; their opinions in the communication channels and decision-making will carry more or less weight, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers who regularly work on free software projects are used to this model.
It makes interaction easier when they collaborate remotely.
It is also useful for them in developing a professional career.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other important consideration in this section, which applies if we want to modify an existing external component, is it is always better if our code modifications are incorporated, sooner or later, into the original product.
That way we can:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduce future maintenance costs.
If the integration is 100%, maintaining the features we have integrated might work out at zero cost to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefit from future improvements to the original product contributed by others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If more people use our features, the City Council will appear as an institution that contributes to the project and free software communities as a whole.
In the long run that could give it prestige and influence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bear in mind, however, that we can plan to facilitate this integration but, usually, we cannot guarantee it will happen in the initial stages of a project.
Each community has its own rules of governance and decision-making rules which must be respected.
But one thing that is worth doing is to keep everybody informed of our plans at all times and try to ensure they converge with those of the community we are addressing:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Don&#8217;t think of community scrutiny as an obstacle to be overcome — think of it as a free design board and QA department.
It is a benefit to be aggressively pursued, not an obstacle to be merely endured.

  If we want to modify or adapt an existing component, we have to be open and clear about our reasons.
As it is a free software component, they cannot prevent us from making modifications.
However, we strongly advise informing them of our needs and technical plans beforehand.
 <br>
  We need to ensure the support community of the component that is to be modified understands and gets involved in our proposal.</p>

  These guidelines establish the technical and social conventions that determine interactions between developers, and between developers and users.

 <br>
  They must be drawn up in English and either be a GitHub wiki page or a test file with light markup language.
 <br>
  The guidelines might grow over time but, initially, only three things need to be made clear:
 <br>
  What communication channels the project has and what each one is used for.
 <br>
  Instructions on how to report bugs and how to make contributions to the project.
 <br>
  A brief description of project governance: who takes decisions and how.
In many cases the only thing that needs to be said is that while the contract is in force, the City Council will prioritise the features to be developed and the bugs to be sorted out.
The Council also has the last word on the technical solutions to be adopted, the contributions to be integrated and the versions to be published.
It might also be mentioned that in the future an appropriate governance model will be studied for the project’s changing circumstances.

  It is very tempting to have closed discussion forums where a small group of people discuss all the aspects of the project, on both a technical and a social level, and from there come the decisions.
But it needs to be borne in mind that open, public communication channels are essential to free software projects, so everyone can read them and subscribe to them with a certain ease.
The reasons are as follows:
 <br></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is very difficult for people to want to make significant contributions to a project where the decisions are taken in a non-transparent way, like a “fait accompli” policy.
That does not mean that project governance has to work like a democracy.
The essential prerequisite is <strong>transparency</strong>: people will want to know why and how decisions are taken, and perhaps have their say, without the option they put forward necessarily being the one chosen.
Experienced developers know that the project has certain needs and not everyone can take part in decision-making with the same weight.
When in the end decisions are taken by the City Council, everyone will understand that if it is made clear from the start, as specified in the <a href="#publicar-breus-directrius-desenvolupadors">Measure: (Day 1) Publish brief Developer Guidelines</a>.
 <br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is surprising how many good ideas can be selflessly expressed through the public communication channels,
if all aspects of the project are discussed there in a friendly working climate.
 <br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the communication takes place in public mail lists and is then filed,
anyone can consult the decision log and avoid repeating previous discussions.
 <br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open, public channels foster a more effective, polite and assertive communication culture.</p>

  A project’s <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> is a document or series of documents that regulates the social rules of participants’ conduct when taking part in the project, including the following aspects:

  Participation rules in all online communication channels associated with the project, such as chat rooms, public and private mail lists, issue managers, feature development tools and pull requests, wikis, blogs, Twitter, forums, etc.
 <br>
  Conduct rules for face-to-face activities of the community associated with the project, such as meetings and conferences.

  A policy of zero tolerance should be maintained in this regard.

<h2 id="_legal_aspects"><a class="anchor" href="#_legal_aspects"></a>7. Legal aspects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free software projects are based on a whole series of technologies, working methods and ways of collaborating but all that would not be sustained without a very special legal mechanism: the free software licences.
The use of such licences in itself guarantees a series of inalienable rights, which allows a certain flexibility about the copyright policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ownership_of_the_code_copyright"><a class="anchor" href="#_ownership_of_the_code_copyright"></a>7.1. Ownership of the code copyright</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until now, contracts with suppliers stipulated that all the software developed for the City Council within the framework of the contract, and associated documents, is owned by the Council.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With free software licences, even though one does not have legal ownership of the source code, that code can be used as often as necessary and for whatever task is desired, as well as modified, adapted and redistributed (the latter under the conditions set by the licence).
So the City Council could waive assignment of the copyrights in the code (provided it obtains the code under a free software license), but for the moment we conservatively continue claiming assignment as the default policy (apart from the exceptions stated in the alternatives below).
The only thing it is not possible to do without being the legal owners of the code is relicense it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main criterion for assessing who should hold the copyrights in the case of new projects, is to think which entity best ensures at each point that the appropriate measures are taken to disseminate the project, facilitate contributions from third parties, make it grow to achieve the objectives and make it sustainable in the long term.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is the default option but not the only one.
It forces the contractor to assign ownership of the copyrights in the code and the documentation that it generates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It particularly makes sense that the City Council should wish to concentrate all property rights on emblematic projects, principally used between public administrations, and on those over which it intends to decide to a large extent the rules of governance.</p>

<p>When we adapt an existing product, to accept the inclusion of our code in the original product we may be asked to sign a Contributor Licence Agreement (CLA) or equivalent contract.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a third option if the aim is for ownership to eventually go to an external organisation responsible for the running and governance of the project in the long term.
Given the nature of the function, that organisation will normally take the legal form of a foundation or other non-profit entity.
This makes sense in projects where, besides the City Council, other public, private or third sector bodies are involved financially and in decision-making.
In this case copyright must be assigned by contract, either directly to the corresponding entity, or initially to the City Council, so the latter can assign copyright to the entity at a later date.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tags: <code>NewProduct</code> <code>Publication</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html">GNU Affero General Public License v3.0</a> (AGPL-3.0) has all the characteristics we need for City Council projects:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a licence with copyleft, as required by Spanish law for public authorities creating free software products, and as it is reasonable to demand of them to prevent private appropriation of what has been financed using public money.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For applications where users mainly interact via the internet, the law does not allow the creation of a closed service using software with this licence (it establishes internet access as a form of distribution for the purposes of the licence).
This is sometimes called internet copyleft.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The licence’s governing body is the GNU project, the non-profit organisation that works for the benefit of free software communities.
Therefore, it is this group of activists and experts who will design future versions of the licence (to adapt it to new legal and technical circumstances) and the legal defence against possible attacks on the freedoms set out in its text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main reason for choosing this licence as the default option are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It belongs to the GNU GPL family of licences, which is the best known.
Most developers are familiar with its conditions, which means nobody will have to spend time researching the licence to decide if they want to participate in the project or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opting for more widely used licences reduces the risk of fragmenting this universal immaterial commons resource posed by free software, a risk caused by the proliferation of licences and their reciprocal incompatibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/introduction-eupl-licence">European Union Public License 1.2</a> (EUPL-1.2) is a licence created by the European Commission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage it has over licences belonging to the GNU GPL family is that it has legally valid translations for all the EU’s official languages: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12" class="bare">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12</a>.[<a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12" class="bare">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12</a>].
Its design has also taken into account the legal diversity of the member states as regards copyright terminology, warranties and applicable jurisdiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like the AGPL-3.0, it has copyleft and internet copyleft.
The copyleft conditions it sets out in the case of linking with other products are softer than those of the AGPL-3.0 and more like those of the LGPL.
However, many legal experts think these differences are irrelevant before the European courts.
The fine details of the differences with the GP-3.0 (and with the AGPL-3.0 too) are explained at: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/eupl-or-gplv3-comparison-t" class="bare">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/eupl-or-gplv3-comparison-t</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this licence (in its latest version, 1.2) should pose a low risk of fragmentation for the free software commons, as it establishes explicit compatibility with the main families of licences with copyleft, including the GNU licences.
You can find more information on EUPL 1.2 compatibility with other licences at: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences" class="bare">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The European Commission, through its Join Up initiative, is the licence’s governance body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Drawback.</strong> It is much less known and less widespread than the GNU GPL licences. Many developers may be hesitant about using it.
At best, they might be convinced that its conditions are very similar to those of the AGPL-3.0.
In the worst case scenario, they would prefer to contribute to another project that has a licence they are used to.</p>

<p>The licence will go in plain text in a file called <code>LICENSE</code> (no extension), in the repository’s root directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The text of the two recommended licences (which should be copied word for word) can be found at:</p>

<p>The <code>LICENSE</code> has to be in English.
When using the EUPL-1.2 licence, which has official translations, we have the option of including <code>LICENSE.ca.txt</code> and <code>LICENSE.es.txt</code> files.

<div class="title">Measure 7.3.C: Include a copyright and licence notice in each code file</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tags: <code>Adaptation</code> <code>Plugin</code> <code>NewProduct</code> <code>Publication</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most licences stipulate the inclusion of a licence and copyright notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means at the top of all repository code files (except build script and installation files) there must be a notice that explicitly states which persons or entities are the code’s copyright holders and which licence establishes the distribution terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to point out under which specific version of the licence it is distributed, and we recommend stating that this will be automatically updated to future versions when these are released (usually to adapt to unforeseeable technological and social changes), with no need to update all the code files.
In the examples given below, this is shown by clauses such as “either version X of the License, or (at your option) <strong>any later version</strong>” or “version X or – as soon they will be approved by the European Commission – <strong>subsequent versions</strong> of the EUPL”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously, the notice must go in a comment, using the comment syntax each program language uses.
And it must also include all the years when modifications have been made to the file.
This would be an example, if we use the AGPL-3.0 on Java code, assuming the copyright holder is Barcelona City Council:</p>

  This must include the declaration of intent and the other information mentioned throughout this Guide that has to be included in the <code>README</code> file.
 <br>
  It must be written in English and the format has to be text with light markup language.
It cannot have an extension if it is written in plain text, or it can have an extension that indicates in what format the markup has to be interpreted (i.e. in reality the file will be called <code>README.md</code> if it is written in Markdown).
 <br>
  The content of this file (more specifically the version posted in the <code>master</code> branch), formatted according to the conventions of the markup language used, is what <span class="line-through">GitHub</span> Gitlab and similar software shows as the development website&#8217;s home page.

  From a very early stage there has to be accessible documentation via web that explains how to use the product on different levels or for different roles: average users, administrators, etc.
In the case of code libraries, the users are code programmers who do not participate in the project.
 <br>
  A careful assessment needs to be made regarding which languages this documentation should be written in, depending on the sphere the product is expected to be used in.
Catalan or Spanish could be the main language but at least the main administration tasks should also be explained in English.
If interest is shown from other countries, it would be worth translating all the user material into English as well.
All code library and development tool documentation must be in English from the start.
 <br>
  The documentation will never be complete and will be constantly evolving.
So it should be easily updatable by different people and we recommend initially using a wiki.
Using the same GitHub wiki avoids us having to create more infrastructure and means the documentation is automatically linked from the repository webpage.
 <br>
  Until there is a lot of user documentation, it is advisable to keep it all together in one wiki page, with a table of contents at the beginning, and not subdivide it into pages, as this makes it easier to search for key words by using the browser search features.
This page should be linked with other documents such as the installation instructions, any tutorials or the optional FAQ list.

 <br>
  This is an alternative for projects that grow a lot and might have started by putting documents in the wiki.
Any documentation found in the wiki must be transferred to the new format and the wiki itself deleted, so as not to confuse users.
If it is clear from the outset that the project will need a large amount of documentation, we can opt to go down this road from the beginning.
 <br>
  All the documentation will go in a <code>doc</code> subdirectory in the repository’s root directory and either be written in ReStructuredText or Markdown, the two markup languages supported by Sphinx.
 <br>
  In this case, given the projects are big and have to aim to attract broad audiences, the documentation will have to be in English, notwithstanding the fact they could be translated into other languages.
 <br>
  Having the code and documentation in a single repository, far from being a problem, facilitates both being synchronised and this being reflected in the commit log.
 <br>
  Link from the:

  Project website.
 <br>
  The <code>README</code> file of the main repository.

has to be explained in an <code>INSTALL</code> file in the root directory of the main repository.
 <br>
  It must be written in English and the format must be text with light markup language.
 <br>
  Some diagnostic measure or command should be included to let users know if the product has been properly installed (e.g. by performing a set of tests, and specifying the expected result).
 <br>
  The installation file must at least be linked from:

  For big projects that aim to attract the attention of lots of people, the big appeal is a demo site.
 <br>
  A video explaining the tool’s use and characteristics might also be very attractive.
 <br>
  If the product has a graphic user interface, it is highly recommended that the explanations be accompanied by screen captures.
They could also be used in the features list described in the #h:2dc43f4e-e755-4fe5-be4e-1f9dd58fe9e9[Measure: Specify a feature list in easily accessible locations].</p>
