<h1>Glossary</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This glossary includes a list of key concepts that are used in this Code of Technological Practices. The concepts have been defined in a non-exhaustive, informative manner with a view to facilitating the use and understanding of the content amongst those accessing the Code, regardless of their level of technical knowledge, to ensure they understand the meaning of these terms.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>PRELIMINARY</strong> <strong>PROJECTS OR</strong> <strong>CONSULTATIONS WITH THE MARKET</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A set of actions aimed at maintaining a dialogue between contracting authorities and the market, prior to the start of the tender.
The objective of these actions is to facilitate a greater understanding among providers’ of the authority’s needs, to study and assess the largest number of existing solutions in the market, and appropriately define the features of the tender.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These processes are especially recommendable where the services to be contracted are particularly complex (and therefore, the solution too) or require innovative solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>VENDOR LOCK-IN</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the field of ICTs, a situation where the provider of a given product or technological service is in a position of power over the buyer, given that once the product or service has been provided, the client lacks the capacity to change the product or provider due to the costs in time and money that the change entails, or for want of viable alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This situation may arise for several reasons, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use of proprietary software only accessible to the provider and which only the provider can therefore guarantee to develop or maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lack of technical skills on the part of the client or organisation, thereby preventing the service from being taken on with internal resources once it has been developed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>OPEN STANDARDS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An open standard is a standard that meets the following conditions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>It is public and available for use for free or at a cost that does not make it difficult to access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its use and application are not subject to payment for intellectual or industrial property rights.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Art. 11 RD 4/2010)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for standards that fall outside the catalogue legally established as “open”, the IMI adopts the following definition:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open and Free Use.
Any intellectual and industrial property rights whatsoever which are essential for implementing the standard, including "essential" patents, must be made available to everyone irrevocably and for free (without royalties).
Reversible agreements on royalties or variable-price formats are not acceptable as they can create problems in free and open-source software and innovation, and in principle, they will not be used unless they are justified in accordance with law.
There must be clear authorisation for allowing the use of any intellectual or industrial property rights in free or open-source software projects.
By the same token, the rights set out in the text of the standard must allow its reproduction and redistribution without any restrictions or need for signing an agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination.
The standard does must not establish technical or legal clauses that limit its use by groups or for a specific purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete information.
The available information is complete enough for multiple implementations of the standard, in the framework of commercial competition, so that they are interoperable.
The components, interfaces, extensions and protocols must meet the same conditions outlined in the standard, to prevent applications or solutions that implement restricted versions of the standard from dominating the market in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open collaboration.
The standard is developed in a transparent process of consensus, open to the effective involvement of all interested parties.
Management of the standard will preferably be the responsibility of a non-profit organisation.
In no case will standards be accepted that are dominated by an organisation or group.
Standards that are actively maintained on an ongoing basis are preferred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>INTEROPERABILITY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ability of information systems, and therefore the procedures they support, to share data and enable the exchange of information and knowledge between them (RD 4/2010).</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organisational interoperability: the capacity of entities and the processes through which they carry out their activities to collaborate in order to achieve mutually agreed objectives relating to the services they provide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semantic interoperability: the ability to interpret automatically information exchanged in a reusable way by applications that were not involved in its creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical interoperability: connectivity between information technology systems and services, including aspects such as interfaces, interconnection, integration of data and services, presentation of information, accessibility and security and other aspects of a similar nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability over time: the ability for elements corresponding to various technological waves to interact; mainly for information that is conserved in an electronic format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical, semantic and organisational interoperability is highly regulated under legislation under Royal Decree 4/2010, of 8<sup>th</sup> January, regulating the National Interoperability Framework in the field of e-Government.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>FREE SOFTWARE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free software is software that can be used, studied and modified without restrictions, and which can be copied and redistributed without restrictions, in a modified or unmodified version or with minimal restrictions to ensure that future recipients will also have these rights.
It can generally be said that a program is free if it allows the four freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for whatever purpose (freedom 0).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).
As with freedom 1, access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free software must not be confused with freeware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Code, taking a practical and technical approach, uses the term free software to indicate software released under licenses indicated as Free Software licenses at <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html</a>; and personalised or customized licenses that comply with the above 4 freedoms.
In many cases, this will be the same as open source software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open-source software refers to all software that can be used, modified and shared (with or without modifications) by any person, and published or distributed under an open licence, according to the "Open Source Definition" published by the Open Source Initiative (or OSI) and stated below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OSI is a non-profit organisation with extensive international recognition and reference that works to establish standards, training and promotes the benefits and importance of using open source.
According to the OSI, a software may only be considered open source where it is published under a licence that meets ten conditions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Free redistribution: the software must be given or sold freely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source code: must be included, published or freely obtainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must allow modifications and derived works: the redistribution of modifications must be permitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrity of the author&#8217;s source code: the licence may require that modifications be distributed only as "patch files”, leaving the source code unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against persons or groups: nobody can be excluded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against fields of endeavour: commercial users cannot be excluded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licence distribution: the same rights must apply to everyone who receives the program and the licence must remain intact when the software is distributed or modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licences must not be specific to a product: the program may not obtain a licence solely as part of a wider distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licences must not restrict any other software: the licence may not compel other software that is distributed with open software to be open source as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licences must be technology neutral: users must not be required to accept licences through a mouse click or other manner specific to the medium containing the software.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We therefore need to differentiate between products such as open source or free software, which give users the freedom to use and improve them, by providing access to the source code and allowing their modification and free distribution, and products that simply provide access to the source code but which do not allow their modification or distribution</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not all products that offer source code are necessarily open source or free, given that, despite their being transparent, they may not allow any modification or distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We consider, for the technical and practical purposes of this Code, that open source software is the same as free software.
Both movements may however be distinguished for their policies, philosophy and ethics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Proprietary software" is software that is distributed under a licence that is not free or open and which does not allow other users to freely modify or adapt and redistribute it.
Its source code is generally not available to third parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY</strong><sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An exclusive set of rights that link a person or entity to an invention or other intangible creation (patents, trademarks or industrial designs), and which may be used by third parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Industrial property grants exclusive rights that allow the person holding them to decide who can use them and how they can be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These rights are granted under a procedure carried out by the competent office (in Spain&#8217;s case, the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office) and protected throughout the entire territory that falls under the office&#8217;s jurisdiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPRETY</strong><sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intellectual property rights are a set of personal and proprietary rights enjoyed by authors and other owners of works (in the case of the ICTs, developments and services) that result from their creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technological sovereignty entails a high degree of decision-making and self-management by an organisation or entity (in this case, the City Council) over the technology it uses in a given field, as well as the ability to maintain and develop it in accordance with its principles and needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach contrasts with the classic dynamics of the supply of ICT services, which has been largely based on the use of licensed proprietary software.
These dynamics have always favoured dependencies on technology providers.</p>
