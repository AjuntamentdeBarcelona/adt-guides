<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>CONTRACTING AS A LEVER FOR TRANSFORMING THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MODEL</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Municipal contracting represents a highly significant injection of resources into the economy.</strong>
Barcelona City Council has an annual contracting budget of some 600 million euros in goods and services (almost 25% of the municipal budget), a figure that surpasses 1 billion euros when taking the municipal group as a whole.
These figures make the City Council one of the driving forces behind economic activity in the city.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Public procurement by the authorities thus becomes one of the main tools for municipal economic policy</strong> and, hence, one of the key
levers for promoting the transformation of the economic and social model in Barcelona.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The City Council seeks</strong> to harness these resources to <strong>promote a new governance and management model for ICTs at the City Council</strong>, as a driving force for this transformation, and make them an instrument for growing the economic fabric of the ICT sector and innovation in the city.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ICTS AND INNOVATION AS KEYS OF TRANSFORMATIONAL</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The evolution of ICTs in general and the widespread use of the Internet specifically are transforming almost every sector of our society and economy</strong> (from manufacturing and transport to energy and healthcare services).
Information and data have become one of the most valuable and precious goods.
These are the main product of what we call the knowledge economy or digital economy.
In this new context, companies are often more highly valued for their ideas and the
information they control than for their material assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This new paradigm, in which the Internet stands out as a channel and tool for production, encourages the emergence of new intermediaries whose added value lies in organising this information and making it available to end users.
Hence, we can find such surprising examples as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the largest private transport companies in the world &#8230;&#8203; has no vehicles of its own (Uber).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The largest accommodation vendor in the world &#8230;&#8203; owns no property (Airbnb).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most popular telephony companies &#8230;&#8203; owns no telecommunications infrastructure (Skype).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most popular media &#8230;&#8203; creates no content (Facebook).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the largest audio-visual content screening companies in the world &#8230;&#8203; owns no cinema or television channel (Netflix).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Undoubtedly, these are all fine examples of how <strong>the use of ICTs – and especially digital</strong> <strong>services – has become a driving force for transformation in services and the associated sectors of the economy.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>It is in this context that cities like Barcelona are facing the need to transform the way they do things</strong> and find new strategies based on technology and innovation <strong>in order to achieve more balanced and sustainable economic growth that can help municipal authorities to act with efficiency and social justice.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TRANSITION TOWARDS TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 6 October 2016, the Technology and Digital Innovation Commissioner presented the <strong>2017-2020 Digital Barcelona Plan: transition towards technological sovereignty</strong>, which seeks “to overcome the challenges for the city and its people through more democratic use of technology.
To foster technological and digital innovation for a more open government as a tool for the development of a plural economy capable of encouraging this social and environmental transformation, and favouring citizen empowerment”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The plan</strong>, which <strong>is based around three key areas</strong>, demonstrates the will of Barcelona to lead a transition towards technological sovereignty – owned by the government and general public – capable of allowing them to participate in decisions and influence the priorities and strategies for the use of technology in the city:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Government and city:</strong> open and efficient government.
Technology for transformation and public innovation via the following:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Digital transformation and innovation in the public sector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing public and open data infrastructure to develop innovative applications based on data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social companies and entities: development of the digital socioeconomic fabric and the local innovation ecosystem,</strong> for the following purposes:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To promote and strengthen the local economic ecosystem and fabric, fostering a plural economy with social return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate access by SMEs to public procurement and foster the creation of quality jobs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Citizens: empowering the public:</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To provide an extensive offer of personalised digital education and training for the various groups in order to facilitate an active and participatory democracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster quality employment and allow digital sovereignty for the general public of Barcelona.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Barcelona wishes to harness the opportunities offered by technology and innovation based on ICTs to improve the services provided by the City Council to the city, placing a focus on citizens’ wellbeing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The commitment is to focus on the real challenges expressed by citizens and concentrate efforts on providing up-to-date public services of the highest quality as a way to encourage a more sustainable and collaborative economy, foster talent in the local economic fabric and empower the general public.</strong></p>

<h3 id="_why_this_guide"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_this_guide"></a>1.2. Why this guide?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide provides <strong>a general overview of the</strong> <strong>municipal strategy for the procurement of technology and technology services</strong> in order to enable an understanding of the various strategic measures and contractual clauses that allow the City Council’s approach to be implemented in this field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>RECIPIENTS OF THE GUIDE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide has been drafted for <strong>managers</strong> <strong>of the various municipal departments and bodies, public service executives and managers, municipal technicians, City Council ICT suppliers, the general public and anyone with an interest in the procurement or provision of technology services.</strong> It offers detailed information on the why, what and how of ICT contracting, including explanations on the content of specific measures and their application.
Specifically, this guide is intended for the following persons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The managers of the various municipal departments and bodies, and public service executives and managers involved in the planning and implementation of contracting procedures (public buyers) so they can have a general overview of the City Council’s strategy in the field of ICT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Municipal technicians responsible for launching a contracting procedure, for whom this text serves as a guide to facilitate the implementation of the various measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ICT companies that are currently municipal vendors or wish to become a municipal vendor in order for them to know which aspects they need to follow when providing their services and during the contracting process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, publication of this guide is an exercise in transparency with the general public as it enables people to gain increased knowledge, monitor and control the measures being taken by the City Council to achieve the targets set.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide <strong>stems from a joint effort by various City Council departments and the IMI in conjunction with the business sector</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Contributions to the content were made by:</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experts and technicians at the IMI on various ICT issues mentioned in this guide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experts and technicians from the Administration Department, Legal Services and Intervention Department of the IMI regarding the legal suitability and validity of the approaches, proposed measures and clauses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support and advice was provided</strong> by the Contracting Coordination Department of Barcelona City Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>various work sessions were held with the companies and vendors of ICT services</strong> to the City Council in order to enrich the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To implement the measures and approaches contained in this guide, <strong>the following steps are being taken:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A website will be created to provide relevant information about the transformation process and municipal strategy in terms of public procurement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The City Council is working to launch a marketplace: a space for dialogue and interaction between vendors, citizens and the City Council that will enable access to all the information on open contracting procedures and future tender processes, and will include information and indicators on the results from execution of contracts that have already finished (among other things).
The aim is two-fold: to raise the profile and increase the transparency of contracting processes; and to facilitate contact between companies in order to foster partnerships, innovation projects and knowledge of best practices in the field of supplying ICT services to the public authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in order to implement all these changes, a series of organisational changes will take place that allow this strategy to be implemented effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_framework_of_reference_sustainable_public_procurement"><a class="anchor" href="#_framework_of_reference_sustainable_public_procurement"></a>1.3. Framework of reference: sustainable public procurement</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Public authorities can use their contracts as effective instruments in the fight against social exclusion, to create quality jobs, promote gender equality and help preserve the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consideration No. 2 of <strong>Directive 2014/24/</strong> <strong>EU on public procurement, approved by the</strong> European Parliament and the Council, states: <strong>“Public procurement plays a key role in the Europe 2020 Strategy</strong> as one of the market-based instruments to be used <strong>to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth</strong> while ensuring the most efficient use of public funds, facilitating the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in public procurement, and <strong>enabling procurers to make better use of public procurement in support of common societal goals”.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is against this backdrop that <strong>Barcelona City Council,</strong> with the desire to draw up a new contracting strategy, <strong>is adopting a series of measures aimed at implementing a sustainable contracting strategy</strong> capable of encouraging an overall improvement in working and environmental conditions in local productive sectors, thereby promoting the common good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The municipal strategy is based around three lines of action:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A set of social measures.</strong> Social inclusion, gender equality and social justice measures to encourage the contracting of works, supplies and services from companies and professionals that execute public contracts under a business model based on decent wages, stable jobs with occupational health protection and ethical conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A set of environmental measures.</strong> These incorporate the technical instructions for applying sustainability criteria in 12 specific fields of activity and a list of possible environmental criteria for those fields beyond the scope of the technical instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A set of cross-departmental measures linked to technology and innovation.</strong> This third line comprises a set of measures aimed at the following:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing the technological sovereignty of the City Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a public and open data infrastructure capable of guaranteeing privacy for the public and increasing the transparency of the municipal authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporating new methodologies that enable the development of innovative and efficient digital services focused on the needs of the people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These measures will have a knock-on effect on the other two lines of action (social and environmental) given that good management of innovation and technology is key to the development of better social policies (social housing, reduction of poverty or creating future jobs) and better environmental policies, as well as for enhancing their effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A good example of this desire</strong> is Barcelona City Council’s membership of the Electronics Watch (<em><a href="http://electronicswatch.org/ca" class="bare">http://electronicswatch.org/ca</a></em>) project for responsible public procurement and employment rights in the electronics industry.
This membership has also led to the inclusion of certain clauses in procurement contracts for electronic equipment in order to respect employment rights and safety regulations in the global supply chains for ICT products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This strategy was adopted following <strong>the publication of a mayoral decree on sustainable public procurement by Barcelona City Council (S1/D/2017-1271, of 24 April),</strong> the first article of which states a desire to promote public procurement that incorporates social, environmental, ethical and innovation measures into the cause and purpose of municipal public measures:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>that guarantee the employment, social and citizenship rights of the people who execute the public contracts and the recipients or users thereof;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that foster a circular and sustainable local economy;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and that promote economic activity by small and medium-sized enterprises, local micro-enterprises and, especially, social companies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The decree incorporates the Guide on Social Public Procurement and the Guide on Environmental Public Procurement</strong> in order to raise the profile of and expedite the incorporation of social and environmental measures and clauses in future specifications, and fore-sees the possible incorporation of measures or instructions in other areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This guide seeks to define the measures linked to this third line of action (ICT and innovation).</strong></p>

<h3 id="_concept_of_ict_contracting_and_procurement_for_innovation"><a class="anchor" href="#_concept_of_ict_contracting_and_procurement_for_innovation"></a>1.4. Concept of ICT contracting and procurement for innovation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY CONTRACTING</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term ICT contracting is used to refer to any process for the purchase, maintenance or improvement of any element associated with the following areas:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication networks and infrastructures.</strong>
Including all those infrastructures that allow communication between two terminals or computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hardware or physical element for the communication and processing of information (terminals).</strong>
Terminals act as points of access to the Information Society and are therefore of extreme importance, representing one of the elements that has evolved the most and continues to evolve: new terminals constantly emerge to harness the digitalisation of information and the growing availability of infrastructure for the exchange of this digital information.
Various technological innovations have contributed to this situation and encouraged a conducive environment, because innovation in terminals goes hand-in-hand with innovation in services (given that the terminal is usually the element that limits access).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software.</strong>
This is the set of computer programs, procedures and documentation that perform certain tasks within a computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital services.</strong>
A digital service is understood to be any service made available to users via the Internet or via any adaptation or application of the protocols, platforms or technologies used for the Internet or any other public or private network, and through which equivalent online services are provided to accompany their offline counterparts.
They are essentially automatic and non-viable in the absence of information technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>PUBLIC PROCUREMENT FOR INNOVATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The City Council wishes to take advantage of the benefits of procurement for innovation and has defined a strategy involving the introduction of a series of measures to ensure its procurement activities foster innovation for the purpose of guaranteeing and increasing wellbeing for the people who live in this region.
Innovation partnerships are a new way to enter into contracts and dialogue with the market in order to meet certain needs that cannot be resolved during standard contracting processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This new approach to public procurement stands as a fundamental tool for obtaining solutions that better meet the real demands of society and help companies be more competitive.
The City Council stands as a driving force for innovation in the market.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It therefore seeks to stimulate the creation of new markets, new products, new production methods and new organisation or supply systems.
The goal is to move away from public procurement that is highly detailed in terms of the technical specifications – often awarded according to best-price criteria – towards procurement that works through defining challenges and innovative sustainable solutions – often involving multiple players.
This new approach will enable the emergence of innovative ideas and solutions that increase efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><em>For more details, please see the Guide on Procurement for Innovation published by Barcelona City Council.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF ICT SERVICES</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of technology, the scope of application of this guide mainly consists of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Acquisition of ICT software and solutions:</strong> purchase of ICT applications and solutions, as well as licences for their use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Development of services and applications:</strong> development, maintenance and evolution of efficient and productive ICT solutions for the public and for municipal employees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ICT infrastructures:</strong> deployment, oversight and control of ICT applications, services and systems for the City Council, including the administration of tasks related to the operation of infrastructures and applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF PROCUREMENT FOR INNOVATION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Barcelona provides a broad definition of the promotion of innovation in its strategy:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It understands public procurement for innovation (PPI) as public procurement that harnesses innovative solutions (products, technologies and processes) emerging in the procurement process to encourage a greater impact on sustainable and inclusive growth in society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the same purpose, Barcelona also promotes the inclusion of innovation in its standard procurement; in other words, the procurement of any product or service with an aspect of innovation.</p>

<p><strong>NEW RELATIONSHIP MODEL</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The traditional vision of public authority action is based on the exercise of authority according to legitimacy under the law and the legal system.
Hence, administrative procedure (and, therefore, public procurement) has been conceived as a closed and extremely regulated process.
This concept has led to an administration model that often acts in an interventionist and authoritarian manner (in the sense of acting under unilateral procedures and from a position of strength).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of public procurement, <strong>this unilateral nature has led to the following results:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Acquisition of not very innovative pro-ducts and services</strong> far from the cutting edge of the market due to the need to define all the requirements and features of the service or product prior to acquisition or selection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long and complex procedures</strong> with a heavy administrative burden (and, therefore, significant costs for vendors) that have become an obstacle to accessing public procurement processes for small companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highly detailed and regulated contracts that are extremely rigid, which offer very little margin for adaptation to possible changes in circumstances or context during the contract term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>However, this paradigm is changing.</strong>
<strong>The main lines of action being promoted by the City Council</strong> to build this new relationship and contracting framework are explained below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>PRELIMINARY MARKET CONSULTATIONS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current legal framework includes the option to launch a dialogue between the contracting authorities and the market prior to launching a contracting process.
The goal is to know and investigate the solutions being offered by the market to meet the needs that are the object of the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Participation of market players during the contract preparation stage presents a series of advantages over the traditional contracting method.
Specifically, the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It gives the market a <strong>better and more in-depth understanding of the needs of the public authorities</strong> and therefore enables the solutions proposed solutions to be better adjusted in terms of price and quality to what the public authorities require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows <strong>the latest innovations in the</strong> <strong>market</strong>, the latest open standards and latest free software to be included, which may be unknown to the public authorities, especially in highly dynamic sectors such as the field of information systems and technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a contracting model with <strong>more</strong> <strong>collaboration between the parties,</strong> which facilitates closer ties between the public authorities and the reality of the market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>MARKET OPENNESS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A more open and transparent relationship with the ICT sector, with simpler, more efficient and more accessible procurement processes</strong> to lighten the bureaucratic burden and reduce the cost of accessing public procurement processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, make use of tender formats such as those based on framework agreements or electronic auctions, which enable the public procurement procedure to be simplified, in order to make them more accessible and less costly for bidders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The negotiation-based tender procedure also enables essential direct contact between companies and the contracting authority, thereby guaranteeing equal treatment, to define and adapt the offers from the market to municipal needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Complex procedures can prevent access to public procurement by SMEs and small vendors that lack the resources needed to tackle traditional documentation and procedural requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this reason, correct tender planning is important so as to make it easier for all potentially interested parties to prepare competitive bids, as well as plan their resources and have time to make the necessary investments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of minimising these barriers is to broaden the range of vendors that work with the IMI, thereby opening up public procurement to the ecosystem of local companies and professionals with talent, helping it to strengthen and grow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TRANSPARENCY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Facilitating access</strong> by vendors and the public to accurate and up-to-date information on the ICT contracts of the City Council, <strong>raising the profile of public procurement processes</strong> and <strong>increasing transparency</strong> has highly positive effects on the openness and accessibility of these procedures:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The public can know how its money is being spent and under which criteria, as well as the results and objectives achieved under the contracts already completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vendors can use a single point to access all the information associated with municipal contracting (planning, contracting, criteria and evaluation measures, strategic position of the City Council, etc.) in order to make it more accessible and facilitate their resource planning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>EXPECTED BENEFITS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this new relationship model is to <strong>encourage more participatory, accessible, agile and flexible contracting procedures, with the following objectives:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce the administrative deadlines and costs associated with tender procedures, making them more accessible</strong> to new suppliers, especially local small- and medium-sized enterprises, which make up the core of the economic fabric.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make public procurement processes more visible and increase transparency</strong>, in order to make them more accessible and inform the public about how public resources are invested and under which criteria, as well as about the results and objectives achieved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Facilitate and foster the procurement of innovative products and services, in line with the strategic objectives of the City Council in terms of ICT</strong> (technological sovereignty, use of open standards, etc.) and incorporating the latest solutions in the market.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DATA MANAGEMENT MODEL</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DATA SECURITY AND ETHICS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The volume of data generated nowadays offers a series of unbeatable opportunities but also poses new security-related challenges and risks.
The City Council must ensure the security of data of the public and the city by protecting confidentiality and integrity, and guarantee quality by adding the appropriate mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the challenges emerging from this new model is the balance between openness policies and the use of data and citizens privacy.
The publication of data must always ensure that citizens privacy is maintained intact, even when various data sources overlap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The data life-cycle must ensure that every stage is developed with ethical respect for the citizens; from how data are generated, stored and shared to the procedures and purposes for which they are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>OPEN DATA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The openness of public sector data (open public data) is a movement being promoted by public authorities in order to make the best use of available public resources and current technological capabilities, presenting the information generated or kept by public bodies and enabling access and re-use for the benefit of any interested person or entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This potentially high-value public information can relate to any topic or refer to any issue (pictographic documents, statistical data, study or analysis results, information on public services, etc.).
Companies, researchers, other public institutions or the general public can make use of the information resources for any purpose, maximising the economic and social possibilities offered by this project: fostering management transparency, improving citizen services, generating business activities and social impact, and seeking efficiency of government.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, sharing data associated with mobility can facilitate the creation of smarter public transport networks, leading to reduced congestion, improved mobility for all and lower energy costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a democratic city, residents must be able to use the shared knowledge base and add to it.
Furthermore, active participation by the public can help resolve the challenges faced by the city.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM THE NEW DATA MANAGEMENT MODEL</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this new data management model is <strong>to enhance the value of the city’s public</strong> <strong>information data and infrastructure, and guarantee</strong> (as an essential requirement) privacy and responsible use of the data associated with the public and the use of municipal public services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new management model for the data resulting from the operation of services, applications and the exercise of municipal powers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to provide a public and open data infrastructure for the development of innovative data-driven applications aimed at <strong>better access to public services and improved quality of life while guaranteeing data sovereignty for the public.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NEW DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New tools and technologies enable the end of the traditional life-cycle of system development structured as a series of highly specific stages of limited scope: definition of requirements, functional design, technical design, construction, testing, user testing, production and maintenance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This translates into a highly significant reduction in time between requirements and roll-out (production).
Generally-speaking, agile methodologies harness this reduction to <strong>build applications more efficiently, more securely, more attractively and in a manner more focused on the needs of the end user.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM THE USE OF AGILE METHODOLOGIES</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of agile methodologies brings a series of advantages over traditional methodologies, especially in the field of digital service provision.
Specifically, the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>More focus on end users, given that they are involved in the entire design, construction and maintenance process for applications and services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More flexibility and greater value.
Increased flexibility in the execution conditions and encourage greater alignment between requirements and real needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facilitate and foster the procurement of innovative products and services that incorporate the latest solutions in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shorten development times.
Implement on-going improvement.
Systemise ongoing improvement based on short review and adaptation cycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transform the organisational culture.
Place emphasis on collaboration and transparency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current way ICT service are provided that is mostly based on outsourcing and the use of proprietary software has led to a certain degree of ICT vendor lock-in at Barcelona City Council.
This dependency has certain undesired effects on the cost of procuring and using information systems, and the public authorities’ ability to maintain and evolve them.
In order to reverse this situation, a series of steps are being taken:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Foster the priority use of free software, and open architectures and standards</strong> in order to help reduce dependency and vendor lock-in, moving towards technological sovereignty for the City Council.
Furthermore, efforts are being made to promote and intensify the creation of solutions in a collaborative fashion with user communities and other public authorities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This technological sovereignty – promoted with open standards – must also be a tool for the common good, generating a new economy, enriching the local ICT sector and facilitating knowledge exchange between different cities.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Define new contractual frameworks that take into account the required education and training of municipal technicians</strong> involved in the software design and development projects in order to minimise dependency on third parties for the management of municipal services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>EXPECTED BENEFITS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to establish a preferential use of free software, and open architecture and standards, as well as to provide the City Council with the profiles and capabilities needed to regain knowledge of the ICT services associated with city management and control of digital services.
The aim of this is to acquire technological sovereignty capable of leaving this knowledge as a legacy for the city itself.
Other benefits include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Facilitating the re-use of systems and solutions, and improving efficiency in the contracting of information products and services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the costs associated with providing and procuring ICT services and products in the medium and long term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guaranteeing interoperability between public authorities and between the various digital services of the City Council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not forcing the public to use technology solutions from specific vendors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guaranteeing technological sovereignty and independence from specific vendors (avoiding vendor lock-in), and the ability to establish proprietary and transparent policies in terms of updates, security and incident management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving the ability to adapt and expand the digital systems of the City Council as needs evolve, and guaranteeing long-term sustainability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="_applicability_of_the_measures_to_ict_procurement"><a class="anchor" href="#_applicability_of_the_measures_to_ict_procurement"></a>2.2. Applicability of the measures to ICT procurement</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>To facilitate the applicability of the strategic measures</strong> by the City Council and the IMI described in this guide <strong>to future ICT service contracts, the annex contains a series of criteria or conditions that can be added to specifications</strong> (technical and administrative) <strong>based on the scope and purpose of the contract:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align: center">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/image2.png" alt="image" width="90%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The incorporation of these elements into a public procurement process can be done in a number of ways, as briefly explained below.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align: center">
<div class="content">
<img src="_images/image3.png" alt="image" width="80%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Incorporation as solvency criteria</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To facilitate participation by as many vendors as possible in the tender process, the criteria should be proportionate (not excessively restrictive).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to ensure that participating companies have the economic and technical solvency to provide sufficient guarantees regarding their ability to execute the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Incorporation as selection criteria</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incorporation as selection criteria enables the value of those offers or solutions that best comply with the municipal strategy to be highlighted.
It should therefore be considered that the elements incorporated as selection criteria are optional, given that they are evaluation factors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Incorporation as condition for performance</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incorporation as a condition for performance establishes an obligation for the successful bidder in the performance of the work object of the contract.
Therefore, its inclusion in this block aims to ensure that the work is carried out under the conditions and guarantees required by the municipal strategy on ICT services.</p>
