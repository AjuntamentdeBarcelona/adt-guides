<p>In all likelihood, unless our need is very specialised, there will already be an open solution (or combination of solutions) that would solve the problem, at least partly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to bear in mind that open code, or open source projects offer more possibilities of being transformed and adapted to our needs than traditional applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finding out if a project suits our needs and meets the minimum requirements on a technical, legal and social level could prove costly.
But the benefits of finding an existing project to join, instead of reinventing the wheel (and avoiding the so-called <strong>Not invented here</strong> or <strong>NIH</strong> syndrome”) can be extraordinary, in the short and long terms:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start with, maybe many of the features we need are already being implemented, so we could build prototypes and carry out concept tests very quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can take advantage of the experience acquired by other users who have tried to implement a system similar to the one we want, possibly discovering opportunities we had not thought about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can share the cost of building a complex tool with other users and organisations.
This includes potential future features and applications, which could in turn interest other users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the product has a sufficiently large user base, we get a tool that develops over time, improving with the contributions of others, adapting to future technological changes and incorporating our new features or those of third parties.
With very little outlay on maintenance we get long-term sustainability and less danger of creating a <strong>technological debt</strong>.</p>

  Here we understand contributions in a broad sense: commits in the code repository, bug reports, translations, etc.
 <br>
  Diversity (different people and organisations involved) is more important than the number of contributions (e.g. the number of commits per month).
 <br>
  If the component shows contributions by important organisations (companies of a certain size, universities, institutions), it is very likely that, even if some contributions fail, the project will continue.
But it could also be a very good sign that lots of people make contributions on an individual basis and these are taken into account.</p>

 <br>
  First of all we need to look at the bug tracker, noting:
 <br>
  The number of defects notified.
We shouldn’t panic if there are a lot of open and unsolved notifications, because the number of incidents tends to grow in a straight line with the number of users but the number of developers usually grows more slowly.
 <br>
  Let the developers gradually respond to the incidents.
We want to stress this point: if there are a large number of users, there will always be lots of open incidents.
The important thing is to see whether the developers are regularly involved in the bug tracker, that they haven’t abandoned it.
 <br>
  Then it is important to look at the project’s public activity, bearing in mind:
 <br>
  How long ago the latest releases were published, news items were posted in a blog or similar site.
 <br>
  The tone, usefulness and diversity of the participants in the project’s discussion forums and public communication channels.</p>

 <br>
  When products have a free or open source licence, it will always be possible to contact someone to get them modified, maintained or have problems solved.
However, we have more guarantee of success if there are already companies or people offering professional support for the component in question, and it can therefore be assumed they are very familiar with it.
 <br>
  It is better if there are various companies offering commercial services in relation to the product than just one, because in the latter case we would be more dependent on that company.
It is a normal business model for the company that develops the product (perhaps without hardly any external community support) to also offer commercial support for it.
So it should not simply be discarded but it is better if the professional support is diversified.
 <br>
  The fact that there are already companies offering professional services in relation to a product at the start could also make it easier to carry out a tentative evaluation of the cost of adapting or maintaining it.</p>

  Transparency is a basic cornerstone of open source software.
Without it, it would be very difficult for all the rest to work well.
 <br>
  If a component has precise, detailed instructions on how to install it, that makes the possibility of carrying out an independent technical assessment of it easier.</p>

The fact that project source codes and management tools (bug trackers, mail lists, forums) are public means that it is possible to obtain some objective metrics on open source software that it would be very difficult to get in the case of privately owned software.
+
Some metrics that can be obtained for certain projects:
+
Number of comments, from <a href="https://openhub.net/">OpenHub</a>.

Percentage of source code in test cases</p>

When we need to adapt an existing source code, if we know the project and the community that sustains it beforehand, it has lots of advantages:
+
Perhaps IMI has already identified key people in the community.

It is possible to make a more realistic estimate, in terms of time and money, of the cost of any intended modifications and the possibilities of them being integrated in to the original product.</p>

Any solution component included in Debian’s stable distribution at the project design stage, or which can be run in the stable version without having to be adapted and which is multi-architecture, is considered to be a durable and reliable component.
+
Otherwise, go for components which, in their standard version downloadable to the project website, can be run on free or open source platforms, preferably GNU/Linux and without any restrictions in terms of:
+
Requiring a particular GNU/Linux distribution (e.g. a program that only runs in CentOS environments and not on Debian).
+
Versions of the main platform elements that are too specific, especially if they are too old or beyond their standard maintenance period (e.g. a program that requires a Linux kernal in a 3.* version, or some basic libraries of the system that are obsolete.

Requiring a specific hardware architecture (e.g. solutions that only run on Intel machines).</p>

 <br>
  When there is a code that has been published with a free licence but the product needs to be developed in a direction that is incompatible with the plans governing the project, it might be necessary to make a fork (in the strict sense of the word, a social fork).
 <br>
  Creating a fork has many disadvantages, so it has to be the last resort.
It is much more difficult to share code with the original product once the fork has been created.
And perhaps even more significant, it implies splitting the original community and forcing each developer to decide which product to prioritise.</p>

  In the case of a contract, include this in the specifications and add that IMI has the last word on including a dependency.
 <br>
  Example clause: <strong>Managing software dependencies</strong>.
 <br>
  The successful bidder should keep a thorough record of all the software packages used in the solution, which have to be distributed under a software licence accepted by the Open Source Initiative (OSI, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses" class="bare">https://opensource.org/licenses</a>) or the GNU project (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html" class="bare">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html</a>).
As an additional requirement, the licence for all packages used should not pose any incompatibility problems with the main product licence, EUPL-1.2.
Barcelona City Council reserves the right to demand a software dependency be removed if it considers that it constitutes a legal risk and the successful bidder has to replace the package with another one, or cover the feature with a development of its own.</p>

  Sometimes it is decided to copy a sub-component that is available in an own repository to the repository of the component we are building (whether it is in source, binary or byte code).
The term for this is a bundled dependency.
The idea behind it is to make a rollout or development cycle easier, but it is regarded as bad practice because:
 <br>

  This can be done on a contract basis and for any development-related task:
 <br>
  Writing code
 <br>
  Writing documents
 <br>
  Revising code
 <br>
  Creating, performing and analysing batteries of tests
 <br>
  We want all our staff to be familiar with software that will continue to be used in the future, once the current contract has expired.
The idea being to increase our technological sovereignty and avoid being dependent on single suppliers as much as possible.</p>
