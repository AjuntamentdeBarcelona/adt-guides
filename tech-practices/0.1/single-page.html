<h2 id="_aim_and_scope"><a class="anchor" href="#_aim_and_scope"></a>1. Aim and scope</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_aim"><a class="anchor" href="#_aim"></a>1.1. Aim</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document constitutes the Code of Technological Practices which sets out the agile digital transformation strategy for Barcelona City Council, in a practical format and under the city’s digital services standards issued in September 2017.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Code consists mainly of a list of clear and direct principles and requirements, enabling a rapid understanding of the various elements of the digital transformation being carried out in Barcelona.
It aims to enable those in charge of governance and management of digital service projects to ensure that they are in line with Barcelona City Council’s strategy in this area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Code is designed to be a practical reference document and does not contain theoretical justifications for the policies proposed or references to examples, except in a few cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The specific guidelines are based on the best practices of various other countries and contexts.
The United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden and the Netherlands, among many other places, have implemented innovative state-level policies on free technologies and agile developments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scope_and_application"><a class="anchor" href="#_scope_and_application"></a>1.2. Scope and application</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Code of Technological Practices applies to the management and governance of technology and innovation projects carried out within the agile digital transformation Plan, not only for the Municipal Institute of Information Technology (IMI) but also for other entities and departments that are accountable to Barcelona City Council.
It also covers the design and construction of all the City Council’s digital services, understood as services for the management and delivery of information through digital platforms and devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is aimed at all the leaders and managers of the municipal group’s business units, programme administrators and staff involved in putting this strategy into action.
Those in charge of each management office are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the strategy guidelines and this Code are implemented.
These principles and guidelines will be put into operation through performance of the City Council’s agile digital transformation projects, which are largely managed by the IMI.
These projects will enable resources to be dedicated, infrastructures to be created and skills to be acquired for carrying out these transformations.
So changes involved in the application of these practices within the City Council will be managed in an iterative way through specific projects.
Some of the projects and their extensions (e.g. Decidim. Barcelona, Sentilo, BIMA) already comply in good measure with the guidelines outlined here, while others will gradually do so in a more progressive manner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_structure"><a class="anchor" href="#_structure"></a>1.3. Structure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The document is divided up into a set of general principles, backed by the guidelines that correspond to the three main cornerstones of Barcelona City Council&#8217;s agile digital transformation strategy.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The development of agile digital services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technological sovereignty, based on the use of free standards and free software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ethical and secure management of data and open data policies</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document complements but does not replace any of the organisation’s policies or regulations, municipal or otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Code of Technological Practices is accompanied by two supporting documents to promote the Agile Digital Transformation Plan: The Agile Methodologies Guide and the Technological Sovereignty Guide.
In addition, the Plan is being implemented through the City Council’s Procurement Guides, particularly the Technology Procurement Guide and the Innovative Procurement Guide.
As for responsible and ethical data management, a key element of the Agile Digital Transformation Plan (particularly the Open Data strategy and the Data Commons, Data Driven projects and interoperability based on free data formats), the corresponding guidelines and their implementation will be developed in a new <em>Government Measure on the Strategy for Responsible and Ethical Data Management at Barcelona City Council</em>, which will specify the required technical details, processes and responsibilities.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_principals_for_designing_and_developing_digital_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_principals_for_designing_and_developing_digital_services"></a>2. Principals for designing and developing digital services</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following general principles and guidelines form the basis of Barcelona City Council’s agile digital transformation Strategy and digital services standards, in terms of their design, development and maintenance.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">1. COMPLIANCE WITH THE DIGITAL SERVICES STANDARDS AND RESPONSIBLE DATA MANAGEMENT</dt>
<dd>
<p>Every new digital service must follow the City Council’s Digital Services Standards and the Responsible Data Management Strategy.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">2. AIMED AT CITIZENS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Barcelona City Council’s digital services are focused on covering users’ needs.
All systems and services are ultimately at the service of the citizens and have to bring utility and added value to their experience.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">3. CLARITY IN OBJECTIVES AND RESOURCES</dt>
<dd>
<p>Projects have to show clarity in the objectives they aim to achieve, in the impact of these objectives and in how they are integrated into the City Council’s strategic plans.
It is not sufficient for a project to be consistent internally and well developed; it must explain how the digital service will meet the specific needs of the City Council and the citizens.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Projects must specify the technical and organisational resources needed for their performance and how these will be provided for.
It is not necessary for all the details to be defined in the projects' initial stages; however, large projects must not be approved without sufficient analysis of these aspects.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">4. OPTIONS ANALYSIS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Every new service must begin with a strategic analysis of the options, to determine whether it has to be built within the municipal organisation, by external providers or by a mixed team involving both.
Similarly, it must establish the development method to be used (by default, Agile), as will whether free software will be created, used or reused.
Part of this process requires looking at the implications in choosing technologies and methodologies as regards the management and training of the City Council&#8217;s internal and external staff.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">5. PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY</dt>
<dd>
<p>The services to be developed will be designed by applying the principles of clarity and simplicity in their use and architecture.
The aim will be to unify the various versions of applications used within the organisation and to avoid the proliferation of different versions.
Transversal solutions to be used across the organisation will prevail over vertical (sectoral) solutions.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever possible, new services will minimise the number of modifications made to “standard” software packages (both proprietary and free software), to make them easier to deploy and use, to maintain the advantages in terms of cost and speed that standard solutions may have as opposed to custom developments and to avoid problems in updating or replacing them.
Any modification or extension will undergo strict technical controls of its budgetary implications beyond those of the project itself (over time and across the organisation).</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">6. AGILE DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES AND CONTINUOUS INNOVATION</dt>
<dd>
<p>All of the IMI&#8217;s technological projects will by default use Agile development methodologies, centred on users, , putting the focus on continuous innovation in accordance with the principles of the Agile Manifesto.
Projects will be developed using iterative and incremental processes, testing hypotheses and creating prototypes, and using analytical and experimental methods.
Projects will use the City Council’s Agile methodology, Scrum@IMI.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">7. REUSING AND PROVIDING SHARED COMPONENTS AND SERVICES</dt>
<dd>
<p>Projects will reuse existing shared digital components and services wherever possible and, where these do not exist or can be improved, contribute to their creation or development, before considering creating parallel alternatives.
This permits costs to be reduced and brings consistency to the users’ experience and to service maintenance.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">8. INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES</dt>
<dd>
<p>New digital services must demonstrate how the components and technology needed to provide them will be vertically integrated.
Systems must be designed taking into account all aspects from user experience to the implications for the system’s architecture and its maintenance.
This will require collaboration between teams in various departments and specialities.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">9. MAINTENANCE AND DOCUMENTATION</dt>
<dd>
<p>Services will follow the corporate classification of information (Service Catalogue) and operate following ITIL best practices.
New digital services must maintain high quality documentation, including guides and manuals made available to the public so that they can be accessible to all stakeholders, both internal and external (such as providers), so that they may contribute to the documentation process.
Documents will be kept in a centralised platform in standard formats, with version and authoring control.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">10. NEW SERVICE ARCHITECTURE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whenever possible, the City Council’s new digital services will avoid traditional client-server architectures, giving preference to web solutions that comply with W3C standards, as these offer more flexibility, interoperability and independence over the machinery and operating systems they run on.
Every new project must contribute to the phasing out of obsolete services, to reduce the number of services and technologies in use.
Where appropriate, development projects for the services will use application programming interfaces (APIs) which will be correctly documented.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">11. ACCESSIBILITY AND DUAL LANGUAGE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Digital services will be conceived from their initial stage in both Catalan and Spanish and will be accessible for all users, both internal users and citizens, in accordance with the linguistic and accessibility style guides in force at any time for the City Council’s services.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">12. SECURITY</dt>
<dd>
<p>Services and projects will be designed taking security into account from their initial conceptualisation.
Services must follow the corporate security Policy and standards based on standard ISO27002 and the national security Framework.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">13. PROCUREMENT</dt>
<dd>
<p>The acquisition and procurement of technological services will apply Barcelona City Council&#8217;s procurement guides, namely, the Social Public Procurement Guide and the Environmental Public Procurement Guide from the Mayoral Decree on sustainable public procurement (S1/D/2017-1271 of 24 April), and the Guides on Technology Procurement and Innovative Procurement.
New services will be procured as a matter of priority under procurement-framework agreements.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support the principle of technological sovereignty of the city, services must avoid dependency on a sole provider; this is also a key factor in increasing the capacity for innovation in public services.
Systems integration must be carried out by a supplier that is different from the manufacturers of these systems.
Whenever possible, the procurement of digital services will increase the diversity of providers and limit the budget volume of contracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compliance with the legal framework and competition regulations will help to promote procurement with SMEs in the city and its area of influence, though where necessary, the city will work with specialist companies from Spain and other countries within the EU.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">14. TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY AND FREE SOFTWARE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Projects must promote technological sovereignty, based on the principles that guide Barcelona’s Municipal Institute of Information Technology with regard to technology and innovation: interoperability, agility, reuse and ethics, as well as free knowledge and technologies.
The IMI will incorporate free software and standards into its technological services and processes, integrated throughout the architecture of its systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">15. CIVIC SOVEREIGNTY OF DATA</dt>
<dd>
<p>Citizens and the common good must be at the heart of all technological plans and platforms within the Barcelona municipality that collect, create or manage data and other information.
Citizens must be able to control their data, the digital divide must be minimised and discriminatory or unethical practices towards the data prevented.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">16. DATA ACCESS AND REUSE, INNOVATION</dt>
<dd>
<p>Municipal institutions must be open, transparent and responsible towards the public.
Municipal information and documents must be accessible, usable and analysable, so as to promote entrepreneurship, social and digital innovation, employment and excellence in scientific research, as well as improving the lives of Barcelona&#8217;s residents and contributing significantly to the city&#8217;s stability and prosperity.</p>

<h2 id="_guidelines_for_designing_and_implementing_digital_services"><a class="anchor" href="#_guidelines_for_designing_and_implementing_digital_services"></a>3. Guidelines for designing and implementing digital services</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following guidelines, divided into three areas, must be followed when designing and implementing digital services:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Agile Methodologies</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technological sovereignty</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsible data management and open data</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the responsibility of both the IMI and the business units that make up the City Council to follow these guidelines in projects implemented by and for Barcelona City Council.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_agile_projects"><a class="anchor" href="#_agile_projects"></a>3.1. Agile Projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To meet the objective of implementing Agile Methodologies in projects carried out by the City Council&#8217;s entities, the following principles and guidelines shall apply:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">1. MULTI-DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION</dt>
<dd>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams will be set up that include the various roles and specialities needed to develop applications, services and processes.
Only one or two people will be directly in charge, although the team&#8217;s success will be shared by each of its members equally.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">2. SELF-MANAGED TEAMS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Teams that are organised independently and flexibly can create new approaches and adapt to new challenges in their environment.
As a consequence, roles and responsibilities within the teams will have a certain level of flexibility and fluidity according to the experience, skills and knowledge of the team&#8217;s members, as well as the needs of the projects.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">3. COMMUNICATION</dt>
<dd>
<p>A communication plan has to be devised, taking into consideration the need for transparency and the responsibilities of the various parties involved.
Key players of the municipal services and processes must be identified, as well as the main players involved on the technical side.
These will receive the communications that must be carried out as frequently as appropriate for the objectives and needs of the projects.
Face-to-face dialogue will take priority over other means of communication.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">4. TRANSPARENCY</dt>
<dd>
<p>The status of the project, priorities, risks, problems, tasks, landmarks, user-stories, contributions and possible "barriers" must be shared in an open and transparent manner with the key players, so that the challenges may be tackled quickly.
This can be done using direct communication or tools adapted to Agile methodology.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">5. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT</dt>
<dd>
<p>Collaborative work practices will be established to promote a culture of learning and continuous improvement, both in the services provided as well as the capabilities of the teams' members.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">6. RAPID FEEDBACK</dt>
<dd>
<p>Teams will do their utmost to make iterations as short as possible.
Team practices will be implemented in such a way as to facilitate rapid feedback, and incorporate this feedback into the project backlog.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">7. ACCEPTANCE TO CHANGE</dt>
<dd>
<p>It is understood that plans and projects evolve and change throughout the provision of the service.
Analysis and planning practices will be established to take this into account.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">8. ITERATIVE APPROACH</dt>
<dd>
<p>Analysis, design, planning and development activities will adopt an iterative approach in short cycles to enable prompt feedback and changes to priorities according to needs.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">9. RAPID AND FREQUENT DEPLOYMENT</dt>
<dd>
<p>Emphasis must be placed on providing value for end-users as quickly as possible, reducing the time it takes to put applications into production and receiving feedback from users in the shortest time frame.
Priority will be given to the minimum viable product that meets users’ priority needs, while the other functionalities will be deployed in subsequent deliveries.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">10. CENTRED ON OFFERING VALUE TO THE USER</dt>
<dd>
<p>Users' needs must be put first, in priority to any other need, including those of the key players.
Where there is a conflict of needs among the groups, we must ensure there are clear priorities.
Diversity within teams will be promoted to foster inclusive designs.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">11. QUALITY</dt>
<dd>
<p>Quality does not just refer to technical quality but also to quality of service.
Quality must be present at every step in the process and everybody in the team has a responsibility to guarantee that the service is of a high standard.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">12. MEASURING PROGRESS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delivering viable software is the main measure of progress.
Other measures also need to be applied that reflect the value provided to users and the municipal services to ensure that they meet real needs and give real value to citizens.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_technological_sovereignty"><a class="anchor" href="#_technological_sovereignty"></a>3.2. Technological sovereignty</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To meet the objective of technological sovereignty  set out in the Agile Digital Transformation Strategy and the Digital Service Standards, in particular to prevent dependency on suppliers (vendor lock-in), the following guidelines, which expand on the principles governing the IMI in technology and innovation (interoperability, agility, ethics and opening knowledge and technologies, both software and data related), are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_interoperability_free_formats_and_standards"><a class="anchor" href="#_interoperability_free_formats_and_standards"></a>3.2.1. INTEROPERABILITY, FREE FORMATS AND STANDARDS</h4>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">1. INTEROPERABILITY</dt>
<dd>
<p>All Barcelona City Council’s digital services will support interoperability based on the use of free standards and formats.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">2. USING FREE STANDARDS</dt>
<dd>
<p>The City Council’s digital services will use free standards on a mandatory basis, and in particular those set out in the catalogue of standards from the Technical Interoperability Standard (as implemented under Royal Decree 4/2010) or the internationally accepted free standards that update, replace or complement these standards.
Where there is no approved free standard for a required format, a format that is intended to be used will be proposed, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable regulations and the IMI’s requirements for free standards (as defined in the Guide to Technological Sovereignty that accompanies this Code).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">3. IDENTIFYING FORMATS AND STANDARDS</dt>
<dd>
<p>The IMI will maintain public lists of technical formats and standards in use, classed as mandatory, priority or recommended.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">4. CHOOSING STANDARDS</dt>
<dd>
<p>The choice of standards will follow an open and transparent process based on users' needs, flexibility, promotion of free competition and free collaboration and any implications for future interoperability.
This process must be formally approved.
The areas that have their own legal framework will comply with the specific standards applicable in that area (e.g. Geodata).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_general_guidelines_on_free_software"><a class="anchor" href="#_general_guidelines_on_free_software"></a>3.2.2. GENERAL GUIDELINES ON FREE SOFTWARE</h4>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">5. ACQUISITION AND PRIORITY USE OF FREE SOFTWARE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Preference will be given to the public procurement and acquisition of tools and systems that use free software, for all the technical architecture of the applications and services that are delivered, avoiding dependency on systems that are not free.
The use of non-free solutions will be only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with criteria established in the Technology Procurement Guide.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">6. FREEING SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION</dt>
<dd>
<p>Both internal and external projects for the development of digital services will be developed from the outset with a view to their freeing, in line with the best practices of free software development, and based by default on free technologies that allow the final product to be released in accordance with the City Council&#8217;s policy and the applicable regulations.
Documentation, design and other elements (sounds, typographies, etc.) will also be made available to third parties under free content licences.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">7. FOSTERING REUSE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Software acquisition will provide incentives for reusing existing solutions.
Development projects in which the City Council participates will attempt, on top of being released under free software licences, to offer technical and organisational facilities for their reuse by third parties.
Where software owned by the City Council and its associated entities cannot be released under a free software licence (for technical or legal reasons), it will be made available to other administrations without the need for any valuable consideration or agreement, in accordance with applicable regulations.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">9. PREPARATION AND PRELIMINARY PROJECTS</dt>
<dd>
<p>The preparation stage of contracts must show that an exhaustive search has been made into already existing and reusable possible solutions, both nationally and in international public repositories.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">10. TECHNICAL AND FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Proposed projects must not include any specification that prevents solutions with free technologies from being proposed, nor must they mention specific products or suppliers unless they are compatible with existing technologies, in accordance with the Guide to Technological Sovereignty.
Architecture and interoperability requirements, and right and ability to modify and reuse the software of digital systems and services, will be regarded as technical features and specifications.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">11. CALCULATION OF COSTS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Every decision on technology acquisitions will take into account the total cost of the system over the long-term useful life of the service (TCO, Total Cost of Ownership), including hidden costs (for example, exit costs to replace a technology in the future when formats or interfaces based on free standards are not used) as well as the net social benefits.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">12. PROCUREMENT OF PROJECTS AND SERVICES</dt>
<dd>
<p>Contracts for new projects or extensions of existing projects will use standard clauses based on these principles, even in preliminary projects where a pre-selection of technologies is made, as well as in framework agreements and contracting in lots.
These clauses will require the use of solutions based on free technology, except in exceptional circumstances as provided for in the Technology Procurement Guide.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">13. BEST DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES</dt>
<dd>
<p>The development of digital infrastructures and services will follow best practices in development methodologies for free software, employing by default the IMI’s Agile methodology.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">14. CODE MAINTENANCE AND DOCUMENTATION</dt>
<dd>
<p>During the lifetime of the contract, providers of ICT development services will collaborate with the IMI to keep the code available at all times in appropriate version-control systems.
Similarly, every system and service must be properly documented and include the necessary instructions for the installation, deployment and configuration of services in free environments.</p>

Collaboration with other interested entities and institutions will also be encouraged, to promote social innovation and local technological products and skills.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">16. SUSTAINABILITY AND GOVERNANCE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Projects that produce free systems and tools through a development service promoted and funded by the City Council must include a sustainability and governance model.
This model will include an approximate definition of the community, support tools, communication and marketing activities, processes for external contributions, the management of intellectual property and the sustainability of the software beyond the project itself for the City Council.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">17. EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTIONS</dt>

<dt class="hdlist1">18. UPSTREAMING AND FORWARD COMPATIBILITY</dt>
<dd>
<p>Where projects developed by City Council staff and/or providers improve or transform an existing free software product, such improvements and any corrections will be contributed, as far as possible, to the original project (<em>upstreaming</em>). Similarly, projects will ensure forward compatibility, as much as possible, so that software adapted for Barcelona City Council will reduce to the maximum the number of potential problems for updating and maintenance.</p>

<p>City Council projects will establish a legal framework for clearly determining and managing intellectual property rights over software developments.
Depending on each case, agreements will establish an ownership model, including options for assigning rights to the City Council or the IMI, leaving them in the hands of the provider, or assigning them to the entities that manage the relevant code for the project, as long as those relating to free projects are available under a free software licence.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">20. LEGAL MANAGEMENT OF SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Projects must establish processes and documents for managing the legal aspects relating to intellectual property and software licences (in particular, in relation to contributions, licences over components used in development and other dependencies of the software), and in doing so, use best practices and standard or widespread-use tools in the sector, to guarantee the traceability and integrity of the code.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">1. SCOPE</dt>
<dd>
<p>This Code of Practice covers the entire set of all municipal data.
Municipal data can be divided, for conceptual purposes, into three large groups:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>a) <strong>Management data:</strong> these are the datasets that the various municipal management offices and entities use for carrying out their work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>b) <strong>Open data</strong>: These are the datasets that the municipal corporation makes available to the public in raw format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>c) <strong>Official statistics</strong>: These are the statistics obtained by the City Council on various datasets, and which are considered Official Statistics.
Only the first set (management data) can include <strong>personal data.</strong></p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">2. REPOSITORIES</dt>
<dd>
<p>The City Council has various repositories available for each type of dataset.
Their definition and management will be linked to the set of technological requirements set out in this Code, as well as data-protection legislation.
There is a transversal comprehensive data repository, within the City OS, which constitutes a single analytical repository of municipal data.
The City OS will be able to include an analytical dashboard of any of the management datasets.</p>

<dd>
<p>Municipal services will be managed on the basis of data-based evidence.
The datasets currently available to the City Council (the Data Lake) will be managed in a more efficient and transversal way so that they can return much greater value to citizens, and allow more complex analyses developed by Data Science.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">4. PLANNING</dt>
<dd>
<p>In order to support the management needs and mission of Barcelona City Council, each business unit will develop and maintain its own Data Management Plan (PMD) to define the objectives of its own information technology resources.
The objectives must be specific, measurable and verifiable so that their progress can be monitored.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">5. INVENTORY AND ACTIVITY RECORDS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Business units will keep an inventory of the principal information systems, their containers and dissemination tools, with a level of detail appropriate for their supervision and management.
In addition, each business unit will keep a record of all the actions taken in both management and analytical databases The Office of the Municipal Data Director (DMD or CDO) will determine the meta-information of these systems.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">6. DATA MANAGEMENT</dt>
<dd>
<p>Business units will continuously enable the adoption of new technologies and evaluate the entire life-cycle of each information system.
Entities will incorporate the following steps, where appropriate, in planning, budget definition and management:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Municipal data will be ethically managed during their entire life-cycle (creation, collection, storage, use-analysis, dissemination, archiving and destruction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Municipal information is managed by enabling its access, consultation and use by the public on the basis of legal provisions in force.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activities carried out on the data will be recorded within an extensive set of meta-information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risks to privacy and security will be identified throughout the life-cycle of the data, performing risk analyses and developing security solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data management will involve a clear allocation of roles and responsibilities to promote the efficient design and operation of all the management processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">7. ARCHITECTURE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Business units will develop an architectural description (AD) that depicts the architecture that is available, the target architecture and the plan to achieve the latter.
The AD for each unit must be in line with the PMD.
The AD must identify which roles may have access to systems and which profiles have access to particular information, and under which circumstances.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">8. INTEROPERABILITY OF DATA AND FORMATS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Business units will promote the opening up of municipal data (Open Data) and interoperability based on free formats, subject to existing technical and legal requirements, to increase the public’s access to municipal information and make operations more efficient, reduce costs and improve services for citizens.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">9. RISK MANAGEMENT</dt>
<dd>
<p>Business units must apply and document appropriate safety measures for designated information and data, records management, transparency, impact assessment and supply chains, and do so during the entire data cycle so that the risks are assessed and managed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">10. RESILIENCE PLAN</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each unit will develop a Resilience Plan.
The Resilience Plan is crucial so that services can continue to operate and carry out tasks during disruptions.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">11. PRIVACY AND THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</dt>
<dd>
<p>Municipal units will only be able to create, collect, use, store or disseminate personal data when they have the required authorisation.
Business units must establish and maintain a data protection programme which ensures compliance with applicable regulations (in particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016) and other privacy requirements, which assesses and manages privacy risks.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">12. PRIVACY BY DESIGN AND PETS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Measures must be taken to incorporate when necessary privacy by design strategies and/or privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), through which the privacy of data subjects is taken into account during all the processes for designing, developing and managing the City Council’s information systems.
When applicable, encryption algorithms, data anonymization or pseudonymisation must be employed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">13. IMPACT ASSESSMENTS</dt>
<dd>
<p>Business units will carry out privacy impact assessments aimed preventively at ensuring that, where data processing my involve especially serious risks, the necessary measures are taken to reduce, as far as possible, the risk of damaging or prejudicing people or of negatively affecting their rights and freedoms, blocking or restricting their exercise or content.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">14. DATA SECURITY</dt>
<dd>
<p>The physical security of the data will be determined by the standards defined by the IMI.
In any event, any third party in charge of data processing must offer sufficient guarantees regarding the implementation and maintenance of required security measures, and the other guidelines defined in this Code and the future Data Strategy of Barcelona City Council.</p>

<p><strong>AGILE MANIFESTO</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto" class="bare">http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/manifesto</a></em>.
The manifesto on agile software development (2001).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration with clients</strong> over contract negotiation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responding to change</strong> over focusing on planning</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, even though the elements on the right are of value, we value those on the left even more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>AGILE METHODOLOGIES</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A set of methodologies used in the field of software development and maintenance based on iterative short-term (typically lasting from one to four weeks) processes that lead to the initial delivery of a partial but operational product and various consecutive versions with increasingly complete features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Through constant iterations, these methodologies seek to provide value from the very beginning of a project, as well as enable continuous development of the product.
Their goal is to introduce improvements and on-going product evolution until a final result of excellence is achieved that fully responds to all user requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such iterative strategies allow risks to be minimised because each iteration is viewed as a miniature project and includes all the necessary stages: planning, requirement analysis, design, coding, user testing and documentation.
Thus, any implementation problems, adaptation to requirements and risks in a project come to light earlier and the corrective measures are less costly and more immediate than in a traditional development project (in which they tend to come to light during the final stage of the project, following months of evolution).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, agile methodologies are focused on user satisfaction because they require active user participation in the project during both conceptualisation and development (via validation of the partial deliveries).
This ensures that the final product responds to the needs of the user and meets user expectations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>AGILE PRINCIPLES</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles" class="bare">http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/principles</a></em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The twelve principles derived from the Agile Manifesto are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
Agile processes harness change for the customer&#8217;s competitive advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplicity&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the art of maximising the amount of work not done&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>COLLUSION BETWEEN COMPANIES</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the field of public procurement, this is an agreement in which two or more companies decide to act in a concerted fashion with regard to the terms and conditions for providing services or selling products under a tender process in order to minimise or even eliminate competition from the other companies taking part in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lack of real competition between possible bidders leads to an artificial increase in prices and worse service conditions, with the corresponding adverse effects on the public and the optimisation of public resources.
Such practices may be especially common in certain contracting procedures, such as those taking place under the framework agreements.
Given that there is a limited number of officially approved companies, it is easier for such concerted action to take place and a falsification of competition to arise in any subsequent secondary contracting processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>DATA SOVEREIGNTY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision-making and self-management powers of an individual or legal entity over the information thereon held by a third party, making the former also responsible for the use and consumption thereof.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ELECTRONIC AUCTION</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Iterative negotiation process for bid selection that includes an automatic electronic bid evaluation device based on price and other variables with no intervention by the contracting authority in the evaluation of auction variables.
The process requires a first evaluation of the bids submitted by vendors, which are then invited to attend the auction so they can offer improvements in the evaluation variables (price or other variables).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a contracting procedure but rather an instrument or tool applicable to various contracting procedures, provided that the nature of the service or product subject to procurement makes this possible under the provisions of the Spanish Law on public sector contracts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>ELECTRONICS WATCH</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Public sector institutions are large-scale consumers of ICT hardware, such as laptop and desktop computers, printers, screens and storage media, and often purchase these products under long-term contracts.
This can therefore create market opportunities for companies that commit to respecting labour law and safety guidelines in global supply chains, making them responsible for any breach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Electronics Watch is an independent watchdog that helps public sector buyers fulfil their responsibility to protect the labour rights of workers in their global electronics supply chains.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An instrument used for the technical rationalisation of public procurement aimed at simplifying the contracting procedures while also reducing the costs associated with these procedures.
It may imply significant advantages for both the public authorities and bidders, such as savings (of time and resources) in the administrative management of the contracting process or immediately providing a pool of bidders whose technical and economic solvency has been accredited.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A framework agreement enables a series of common terms or conditions to be established in a single process that are valid for multiple contracts arising while the framework agreement is in effect.
Hence, any secondary contracting processes stemming from the framework agreement are quicker and easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even so, it should be remembered that it can also lead to negative effects on competition given that, as a result of the official approval process, a certain degree of market closure may take place and collusion between officially approved companies may be made easier.
A limited term and scope of the framework agreement, as well as the definition of certain specific criteria for awarding secondary contracting processes, allow these adverse effects to be reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>FREE SOFTWARE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software that can be used, studied and modified without restriction and that can be copied and redistributed, either in a modified or unmodified version with no restriction or with certain minimum restrictions to ensure that the future recipients also have these rights.
It can generally be said that a program is free if it allows the four freedoms defined by the Free Software Foundation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for whatever purpose (freedom 0).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The freedom to study how the programme works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).
As with freedom 1, access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Free software must not be confused with freeware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document, taking a practical and technical approach, uses the term free software to indicate software released under licenses indicated as Free Software licenses at <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html</a>; and personalised or customized licenses that comply with the above 4 freedoms.
Free software is distinguished from open source software in their policies, philosophy and ethics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open-source software refers to all software that can be used, modified and shared (with or without modifications) by any person, and published or distributed under an open licence, according to the "Open Source Definition" published by the Open Source Initiative (or OSI) and stated below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OSI is a non-profit organisation with extensive international recognition and reference that works to establish standards, training and promotes the benefits and importance of using open source.
According to the OSI, a software may only be considered open source where it is published under a licence that meets ten conditions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Free redistribution: the software must be given or sold freely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source code: must be included, published or freely obtainable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must allow modifications and derived works: the redistribution of modifications must be permitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrity of the author&#8217;s source code: the licence may require that modifications be distributed only as "patch files”, leaving the source code unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against persons or groups: nobody can be excluded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No discrimination against fields of endeavour: commercial users cannot be excluded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licence distribution: the same rights must apply to everyone who receives the program and the licence must remain intact when the software is distributed or modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licences must not be specific to a product: the program may not obtain a licence solely as part of a wider distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licences must not restrict any other software: the licence may not compel other software that is distributed with open software to be open source as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licences must be technology neutral: users must not be required to accept licences through a mouse click or other manner specific to the medium containing the software.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A distinction must therefore be made between products such as free or open source software that give users the freedom to use it or improve it by providing access to the source code and allowing modification and free distribution from products that simply provide access to the source code but do not allow its modification or distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, not all the products that offer the source code are necessarily open source or free given that, although transparent, they do not allow its modification or distribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this regard, it is important to note that – for all legal and contractual purposes – open source is the same as free software.
The two movements differ in terms of their policy, philosophy and ethics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, in this guide, we will use the term open source as synonymous with free software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Proprietary software" is any software distributed under licence that is not free or open source, and that does not allow free modification or adaptation and redistribution by another user.
Generally-speaking, the source code is not available to third parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>FREEWARE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A type of software that is distributed for free but has a usage licence that prohibits other users from modifying or, in some cases, freely using its code.
The user has no access to the source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY</strong><sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A set of exclusive rights that correspond to one person or entity over an invention or other immaterial creation produced by that person (patents, brands or industrial designs) which may be susceptible to use by third parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Industrial property grants a series of exclusive rights that allow the person holding them to decide who can use them and how.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Intellectual property comprises the set of personal and property rights that correspond to the authors and other owners over the works they create (in the case of ICT, software developments and features).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>INTEROPERABILITY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ability of information systems, and therefore the procedures they support, to share data and enable the exchange of information and knowledge between them (RD 4/2010).</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organisational interoperability: the capacity of entities and the processes through which they carry out their activities to collaborate in order to achieve mutually agreed objectives relating to the services they provide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semantic interoperability: the ability to interpret automatically information exchanged in a reusable way by applications that were not involved in its creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical interoperability: connectivity between information technology systems and services, including aspects such as interfaces, interconnection, integration of data and services, presentation of information, accessibility and security and other aspects of a similar nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability over time: the ability for elements corresponding to various technological waves to interact; mainly for information that is conserved in an electronic format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical, semantic and organisational interoperability is highly regulated under legislation under Royal Decree 4/2010, of 8<sup>th</sup> January, regulating the National Interoperability Framework in the field of e-Government.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>MARKETPLACE</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A technology platform that will facilitate relations in the field of public procurement between service or product vendors and buyers, in this case the municipal authorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of this platform is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To become a point of reference and access to all the information associated with municipal public procurement (information on the municipal procurement strategy, the planning of future procedures, ongoing procedures, tender results, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate the procurement of ICT goods and services for all municipal bodies and entities via an electronic market, with the ultimate goal of completing a transaction under the best possible conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To facilitate communication between the public authorities and its vendors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the platform seeks to offer information to the public, make public procurement processes more visible and increase transparency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>NEW ECONOMY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also known as the knowledge economy or digital economy, it is dominated by the use of information and especially the data (becoming one of the most valuable and precious goods) generated through the use of digital services and technology or communication products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within this new context, in which the Internet stands out as the main production channel and tool, companies are valued for their ideas, information or capacity to do more with less.
On the one hand, business can be done with the whole world and, on the other, the level of interactivity offered by the Internet allows products to be adapted to consumer tastes at great speed.
However, the avalanche of information and possibilities offered by the Internet leads to the emergence of new intermediaries, those known as infomediaries, which bring added value by organising information for users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>OPEN DATA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the public-sector field<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>, open data refers to the data sets made available to the public for reuse and republication with the main goal being to make maximum use of available public resources by presenting the information generated or kept by public authorities and enabling access and reuse for the benefit of any interested person or entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This potentially high-value public information can relate to any topic or refer to any issue (pictographic documents, statistical data, study or analysis results, information on public services, etc.).
Companies, researchers, other public institutions or the general public can make use of the information resources for any purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to maximise the economic and social possibilities offered by the data that is stored: foster management transparency, improve citizen services and generate business activities and social impact while always in search of efficient governance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>OPEN STANDARDS</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An open standard is a standard that meets the following conditions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>It is public and its use is available for free or at a cost that does not prevent accessibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its use and application do not depend on the payment for an intellectual or industrial property right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Art. 11 RD 4/2010)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As regards those standards not included in the catalogue legally established as “open”, the IMI adopts the following definition:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Free to use and free of charge</strong>.
Any intellectual and industrial property rights required for implementing the standard (including “essential” patents) must be made available to everyone irrevocably and for free (royalty-free).
Reversible agreements on royalties and variable price formulae are not acceptable, as they can create problems for free and open source software and for innovation.
In principle, they will not be used unless their use is justified by law.
Clear authorisation must exist to allow the use of intellectual or industrial property rights in free or open source software projects.
Furthermore, the rights in the text of the standard must allow it to be reproduced and redistributed without restriction or need to sign an agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-discrimination</strong>.
The standard must not establish technical or legal clauses that limit its use by certain groups or to a specific purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complete information</strong>.
The information available is sufficiently complete for multiple implementations of the standard, within a commercial competition framework, so that these implementations are interoperable.
The components, interfaces, extensions and protocols must meet the same conditions as the standard in order to prevent, in practice, the market being dominated by applications or solutions that implement restricted versions of the standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open collaboration.</strong>
Development of the standard must take place within a transparent process of consensus, open to effective participation by all stakeholders.
Preferably, governance of the standard is the responsibility of a non-profit organisation.
Under no circumstances will standards that are dominated by one organisation or group be accepted.
Standards that are actively and permanently maintained are preferred.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>PRELIMINARY PROJECTS OR CONSULTATIONS WITH THE MARKET</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A series of measures aimed at maintaining a dialogue between the contracting authorities and the market prior to launching a contracting process.
The purpose of this practice is to facilitate a better understanding of the needs of vendors, to study and assess the broadest possible range of solutions that exist in the market, and to suitably define the characteristics of the tender.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These processes are especially recommended when the services to be contracted are particularly complex (and, therefore, so is the solution) or require innovative solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>SOLVENCY CRITERIA</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A set of economic, organisational and technical criteria that accredit the capability of a bidding company and determine its viability for providing a certain product or performing a service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technological sovereignty implies a high level of decision-making and self-management powers for an organisation or entity (in this case, the City Council) over the technology used in a certain field, as well as the ability to maintain and evolve the same according to its principles and needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This approach contrasts with the traditional ICT service supply dynamic, which has partly been based on the use of licensed proprietary software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These dynamics have led to a dependency on technology vendors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>VENDOR LOCK-IN</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the field of ICTs, a situation in which the vendor of a given technology product or service is in a situation of power over the buyer given that, once the product is implemented or service provided, the customer is not able to switch product or vendor due to the cost in time and money that the change may imply or due to a lack of viable alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This situation may arise from various factors, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use of proprietary software only accessible to the vendor that can therefore only be evolved or maintained under guarantee by the same vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of technical training of the customer or organisation that does not allow the service to be taken over using internal resources once it has been developed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
